1. Preface

MCDPlayer is public domain, meaning that you can use and spread the
program as you want.

You are using MCDPlayer on your own risk. I cannot be held responsible
for any damage caused by MCDPlayer. This includes system crashes, bugs
in the program or this documentation.

This will be the only distribution of MCDP done by me. It works fine
with some SCSI2-CDROMs (i.e. Toshiba 4101, 3401, SONY CDU-554) but
refuses to run on others (NEC). I don't have the time to search for
bugs that occurs in combination with hardware that I do not own.
I hope there's anyone who will continue development of MCDP.

2. The purpose of this program...

...is to play audio CDs (CDDAs) on your CD-ROM drive. Therefore it must
be connected to a SCSI-host.

MCDP has some special features:

- Very compact GUI on your Workbench screen
- GUI is designed like a CD player
- direct access of first 20 titles of every CD
- automatically detects CDs and displays the interpreter, the CDs title
  and the name of the title currently played.
- automatically detects the change of the CD.
- Editor to add new CDs to your database.
- Editor for programming
- Configuration using tooltypes: SCSI-device and -unit, window position
  and path of CD database
- Commodoty with hotkeys for start/stop/title selection


3. Installation:

Before you start it for the first time, you should adapt the tooltypes
of MCDPs icon to your hardware configuration:

FONTNAME=<name>.font
   Replace <name> with the name of the font you want to use in the
   display. There are 4 Fonts in the MCDP archive:
   - MCDP_DOT.font : Looks like a dot matrix LCD display
   - MCDP_LCD.font : Looks like a segmented LCD display
   - MDCP_LC2.font : LCD display font including lower case characters
   - MCDP_STD.font : Best readable but somehow boring
   You must copy at least one of these fonts to your FONTS: drawer and
   set its name in the tooltypes.

SCSI_DEV=<name>.device
   Insert the device name of your SCSI host as <name>. Commodore uses
   scsi.device as device name for their hosts. This is the default value.

SCSI_ID=<nr>
   SCSI-ID of your CD-ROM drive. As this number must be in the range of
   0 to 6, you can detect it by "try and error" if you don't know it.
   Default value is 1.

SONGPATH=<path>
   Use this tooltype to determine the path where MCDP will save its CD
   database. Default is the actual drawer at startup.

WND_POS=<path>
   MCDP opens its window on the default publicscreen. You can determine
   the position:
   0: Centered to the visual part of your screen (if your screen doesn't
      auto scroll: centered to the screen)
   1: right upper corner of the screen
   2: left upper corner of the screen
   3: left lower corner of the screen
   4: right lower corner of the screen
   The editor windows always open in the screen center.

Wrong settings lead to the following results:

- MCDP refuses to start: Wrong device name or unoccupied SCSI-ID.
- MCDP starts, but only shows the "breadless arts" logo: The ID doesn't
  belong to a CD-ROM drive or it is not operable.
- MCDP opens its window and closes it instantly: The font can't be
  found.

Now you can start MCDP from Workbench. It is also possible to start it
from Shell by using the tooltypes as parameters:

MCDP "SCSI_DEV=gvpscsi.device" "SCSI_ID=1" "SONGPATH=Music:CDs/"


4 Bedienung:

The "Look & Feel" of MCDP is almost identical to a CD player. So there
should be no problems.

I'll describe the gadgets below the display first, beginning at the
left edge:

Play ( > ):
  Play CD, beginning with the first title. In program mode, playing
  starts with the first title of the program. In both cases the CD-ROM
  must have been in idle state before, the play symbol ( ">", right
  lower corner of display ) mustn't have been visible.

Pause ( || ):
  Pauses playing until this Gadget is klicked again.

Stop ( [] ):
  Stops playing and quits program mode.

Skip backwards ( |< ):
  Skips to the title that has been played before the actual one.

Skip forward ( >| ):
  Skips to the next title.

Search backward ( << ):
  Jumps 20 seconds backwards in the actual title.

Search forward ( >> ):
  Jumps 20 seconds forward in the actual title.

Eject ( ^ ):
  Eject CD.


At the right side of the display you find some more gadgets:

Number gadgets ( 1-19 ):
  In standard mode you can select the first 19 titles of the CD
  directly. In program mode the keys 1-8 select the actual pro-
  gram, the others are unused.

Direct input ( + ):
  Now you can type in the title number using the number gadgets
  1 to 10 (= 0).

Edit title list ( LIST ):
  You see a window with some gadgets to put in the interpreters
  and the CDs name and the names of all titles. To leave this
  window you find the same gadgets as in the preferences pro-
  grams of your workbench.
  After you saved the title list of a CD, this CD will be iden-
  tified whenever you insert it. The titles are displayed.

Edit programs ( PGM ):
  In the program window, you see two big lists: On the left side,
  all titles of the actual CD are displayed. The list on the
  right side is empty. It will hold the programmed titles. The
  gadgets between the two lists are used to clear the actual
  program (New), to select the selection mode of the program
  list and to select the actually edited program.

  The programming system is very simple: Whenever you select a
  title of the left list, it is appended to the program list. If
  you select a title in the right list, the action depends on
  the selection mode: It can be deleted or moved up, down, to
  the top or to the bottom of the program list.

Start program mode ( PG# ):
  This gadget activates the program mode of MCDP. The display shows
  "PGM" then. If you klick on "Play" now, the first title of the
  start program will be played. Alternatively, you can select the
  number of a program using the number gadgets before.


5. Keyboard control:

MCDP uses the numeric keypad in conjunction with Ctrl and the left
Alt key as hotkeys for all basic functions. Therefore, the window
doesn't necessarily have to be selected.

The keys are assigned as follows:
   __ __ __ __
  |  |  |^ |+ |
  |__|__|__|__|  Enter  Start
  |7 |8 |9 ||<|  .      Stop and quit program mode
  |__|__|__|__|  1-9    Play title 1-9
  |4 |5 |6 |>||  0      Play title 10
  |__|__|__|__|  +      Play next title
  |1 |2 |3 |> |  -      Play previous title
  |__|__|__|  |  /      Eject CD
  |10   |[]|  |  *      Direct input
  |_____|__|__|
