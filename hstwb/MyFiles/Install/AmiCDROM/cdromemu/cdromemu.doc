cdromemu.device   Version 1.1
===============

Cdromemu.device emulates a trackdisk device which reads a CDROM image from
an AmigaDOS file. It is useful for CDROM manufacturers which want to verify
the output of their pre-mastering program.

Installation:

  1. Copy "cdromemu.device" to the directory DEVS:

  2. Set the environment variable CDROM_FILE to the name of the file
     which contains the CDROM image.

  3. Set the following options in the Startup field for AmiCDROM:
  
       "DEVICE=cdromemu.device UNIT=0 TRACKDISK"
     
     Add other startup options according to the AmiCDROM manual (e.g.
     "ROCKRIDGE".)

  4. If you also want to use the "cdrom" or "cdcheck", then set the
     following environment variables:
     
           variable           value
           ---------------    ---------------
           CDROM_DEVICE       cdromemu.device
	   CDROM_UNIT         0
	   CDROM_TRACKDISK    1


The following commands are possible:

  cdromemu remove	remove the image file (CDROM_FILE) from the
  			virtual drive (i.e. the lock on the file will
			be removed; it can now be replaced by another
			file).

  cdromemu insert	inserts the image file (CDROM_FILE) into the
  			virtual drive.

The commands "insert" and "remove" also modify the results of the
TD_CHANGESTATE and TD_CHANGENUM commands.
