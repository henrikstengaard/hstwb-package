These are old common viewers that have been replaced with renamed 
executables in the "C" and "Utilities" directories.

This has the advantage of causing any text files calling for these 
old viewers in their icon "default tool" opening superior programs 
instead.

The original executable files are here in case any one needs them for
reasons such as installing stand alone viewers on Workbench disks.
