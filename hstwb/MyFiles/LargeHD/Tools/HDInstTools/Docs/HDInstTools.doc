HD Installation Tools

1. Software Installation of a Harddisk

1.1 General Information

This chapter guides you through the software installation of
your harddisk. If you purchased an entire system, your harddisk
is already installed. In that case, you may start using your
harddisk right away, and this chapter is not of importance to
you.

1.2 Starting the Amiga

Insert the included disk into your Amigas floppy drive and
start up your computer. All files needed for startup are on the
disk.

1.3 Starting the Program

The installation program »HDInstTools« is located in the root
directory of the disk included. To start the program, open the
disk window first, by double-clicking the disk icon with the
left button of your mouse. The disk window opens immediately,
displaying all icons of the programs on it. Double-click the
»HDInstTools«-icon to start the program. After loading the
program from disk, the main window and another window above
appears. The controller searches for connected devices in the
upper window. A filling bar indicates the status of progress.
As soon as the search process is completed, the window
disappears automatically.

1.4 Choosing a Language

By default, the program starts in English. If you would like to
use the program in a different language, please select the item
SETTINGS/LANGUAGE in the pull down menu. A list of languages
will be displayed immediately for you to choose from. Leave the
window with USE. The main window should now appear in the
selected language.

1.5 Installing the Harddisk

The main window displays a list of all devices found as
desribed in section 3.3. Please double-click the harddisk that
you would like to install. You can distinguish between them
using the displayed list. A window appears asking you to
confirm your choice. Please click OK if this the harddisk that
you would like to install.

All parameters of the harddisk are determined and selected
automatically and a partition is created. All data is written
to the harddisk and the partition is formatted.

1.6 Copying Disks

Last but not least, a requester appears asking whether you
would like to copy the contents of a disk to the partition and
if so, requests you to insert a disk in the disk drive »df0:«.
Just insert your Workbench-disk and click OK. However, if you
would like to copy your own software to the partition, please
abort at this point.

Important! If you want to install a Workbench 2.0 or higher
from the beginning you have to use the installation program of
the Workbench. Therefor please read the Workbench manual. It
isn't enough to copy only the Workbench disk onto the harddisk.

1.7 The Final Step

That's all. You have now installed your harddisk. Please reboot
your computer by clicking the REBOOT gadget and your system
will start the Workbench from your new harddisk, provided that
you copied it as described in the section above.

2. HDInstTools

2.1 System Requirements

This program requires an Amiga with at least 512 kByte of RAM -
memory and an Amiga operating system 1.3 or higher. Of course a
controller with at least one mass media storage device is
required for sensible use. This program supports all controllers,
which use the Amiga Rigid-Disk-Block (RDB or RDSK) standard.

2.2 Installation

In order to install the program on your harddisk you must drag
the »HDInstTools«-icon from the disk window to the harddisk
window. This requires of course, that you have already
installed your harddisk. Until then you can use the program
from the disk. If you like, you may also create a directory for
the »HDInstTools« to copy the program into that drawer. This
completes the installation.

2.3 Compatability

Please note: A harddisk installed with the »HDInstTools« from
scratch may not be altered with the ALF-programs »InstallAlf«
and »AlfPrefs« anymore. The »HDInstTools« install the harddisks
in such an optimized form, that the ALF-programs cannot cope
with them anymore. If you do not obey this, the ALF-program will
remove the installation of your harddisk and all your data is
lost. However, if you installed your harddisk with
»InstallALF« or »ALFPrefs«, you can use »HDInstTools« without
problems. This applies in most cases and probably also in
yours. If that is so, you do not need to reinstall your
harddisk.
The program is fully compatible with harddisks installed with
the Amiga HDToolBox program. Harddisks installed with HDInstTools
can safely altered with HDToolBox and vice versa.

2.4 Operation Instructions

The program is controlled with a mouse. In many cases you can
also use your keyboard by pressing the corresponding key of the
underlined letter in the gadget you wish to select.

2.5 The Procedure

The following steps given in short form give you an idea of
what it takes to install your harddisk.

   Prepare the device: In most cases you will not need to
   change the settings determined by the program.

   Filesystem: You may decide which type of filesystem you
   would like to save on the device.

   Partition drive: You may create a new partition with Add
   Partition.

   Edit partitions: This allows you to rename a partition, to
   make a partition smaller or to add another partition.

   Saving changes to disk: The selections you made in the last
   four steps are saved to the RigidDiskBlock on your harddisk.

   Formatting DOS: Prepares a partition for the use of
   AmigaDOS.

   Copy disk: Copies the contents of an entire disk to a
   partition.

Naturally you do not have to execute all of the steps described
above. Just use whatever is necessary when installing your
harddisk. In case you would like to change the partitions, like
the names or the buffers for example, all you need to do is
edit the partition and save the changes to your harddisk.

2.6 Pull Down Menu

Many of the items in the pull down menu can be selected using a
key combination. To select an item press the <right Amiga> key
and the key displayed next to the function in the pull down
menu.

2.6.1 Project/Scan

This function searches for devices connected to the controller.
You do not need to restart the computer and the program, if you
connected one or more devices during operation. After selection
of the item a display appears giving the status of the search
process. You may stop the process by clicking Cancel.

If a device is found, the program tries to identify it and
determine its parameters. The devices found are then displayed
in the list of all available devices in the main window, as
well as their status.

2.6.2 Project/Info

An information window displays the currently used driver name,
the current installation mode, whether logical IDs are
supported and whether controllers of the same kind are also
searched for. It also displays the size of the main memory, the
graphic memory and the largest available block of free memory.
You can quit this window by selecting OK. When this window is
open, no other function can be selected.

2.6.3 Project/About

This window contains the program name, the version number,
copyright information and the names of the authors. Quit this
window with OK. When this window is open, no other function can
be selected.

2.6.4 Project/Quit

It was hard to guess, but with Quit you leave the program. You
may also quit the program by clicking the close gadget in the
upper left hand corner of the main window. Before the program
quits, you are asked to confirm your choice. Click YES if you
like to quit, or NO if you would like to continue using the
program.

2.6.5 Settings/Language

You may choose one of the available languages with this
function. As soon as you have selected this item, a list of
languages will be displayed immediately for you to choose from.
The current language is highlighted. Select a language and
click USE to leave the window. If you select Cancel you'll
leave the window without using the changes made. In order to
save the changes for later use, select Settings/Save.

2.6.6 Settings/Mode

With mode you may select between one of two installation modes.
Depending on the selected mode some functions in the main
window or in the pull down menues are disabled and can
therefore not be selected.

In the automatic mode all decisions concerning the installation
and selection of parameters for your harddisk are taken by the
program. This way you aren't given a chance to make any
mistakes. The manual mode gives you access to all parameters.
Please note that in this mode you have access to parameters
that my lead to serious problems or malfunction, if they are
set wrong.

2.6.7 Settings/Save

This lets you save all changes made in the settings. You will
not be asked to confirm your choice. The settings are saved in
the »ToolTypes« of the icon.

2.6.8 Extras

All functions mentioned above, are described in further detail
in later sections.

2.7 Main Window

This window displays a list of all available devices, as well
as several gadgets used to access the different parts of the
program.

2.7.1 Devices in System

This list contains all devices which can be accessed by the
driver set in »ToolTypes«.

PIC:

This number distinguishes between several controllers connected
to one computer. In case you have only one controller in your
computer this will always be set »0«. The support of several
controllers is enabled or disabled with the keyword »PIC« in
the »ToolTypes«.

LUN:

The logic unit number distinguishes between possible installed
logical sub-devices in the computer. The support of several
logical sub-devices is disabled with the keyword »LUN« in the
»ToolTypes«.

TID:

This states the identification number (Target ID) of the listed
devices. This number is set via jumpers or switches directly at
the device. It is recommended to start counting with the
identification number zero.

Manufacturer:

The heading »Manufacturer« lists the name of the devices'
manufacturers. The program itself determines this information
from the devices directly.

Name:

This lists the names of all devices in the system.

Status:

This indicates the status of the listed devices. Unmodified:
These devices are installed correctly and completely. The
device specifications could be determined and the examination
of the determined data showed no faults. Modified: If a device
is listed as modified, there may be several reasons for this.
The device may be installed partially or not at all, or the
environment has changed. For example: The identification number
of the controller is stored in the devices data. In case you
changed the ID-number of the controller, the device will also
be marked as changed in the list. In this particular case the
examination of the device data would show that the
identification number of the controller does not match the
system data of the device. Not ready: This status indicates
that the device is basically okay, but is not ready for
operation yet due to some kind of problem, e.g. disk drive
without medium. Unknown: Devices with this label cannot be
installed by the program, e.g. streamers or CD-ROM drives.

2.7.2 Automatic Installation

If you activated the automatic mode in the settings function of
the pull down menu, you can have a device installed
automatically, by double-clicking it in the list. The
installation process will proceed as described under
»Procedure«.

Before the installation is performed, you are requested for
confirmation. Then everything else is done automatically. You
will also be asked to insert a disk, e.g. a Workbench - disk,
into the first disk drive. The contents of the disk will then
be copied to the partition. Finally, a display panel informs
you that the device is completely installed. The device now has
a partition for you to work with.

2.7.3 Close Gadget

In order to leave the program, simply click the close gadget in
the upper left hand corner of the main window.

Before you actually leave the program, you are requested to
confirm whether you really want to quit the program. Click YES
if you are sure and NO if you would like return to the program.

2.8 Setup Drive...

This function is only available when working in the manul mode.
Otherwise the gadget is disabled and ghosted.

When clicking on Setup Drive... a new window opens. This window
displays various data of the device selected. If the device was
previously installed, the data is read from the
»RigidDiskBlock«. In case the device does not have a
»RigidDiskBlock« yet, all necessary data is requested with an
»Inquiry« from the device and is partially compiled by the
program.

All data concerning the devices is stored in the
»RigidDiskBlock« on the device and is partially evaluated by
the driver and the Amiga upon booting.

Use:

Click Use and all changes of data are adopted or maintained.
Finally these changes can be saved by using the function SAVE
CHANGES TO DRIVE.

Cancel:

If you do not want to keep your changes or you were just
peeking, choose Cancel to leave the window again. All changes
are lost.

2.8.1 Information

This data is saved in the »RigidDiskBlock« (RDSK block),
however, it will not be used unless you reinstall the device.
In that case all of the stored data in the RDSK block is
retrieved and displayed.

Type:

This indicates what kind of device it is, e.g. hard disk,
removable disk, CD-ROM, streamer, scanner, etc.

Manufacturer:

This field contains the name of the manufacturer, e.g.
»Quantum«. This information is determined during initial
start-up via direct »Inquiry« from the device. In case no name
could be found, or the name makes no sense, you may alter the
name. In order to do so, simply click the text gadget.

Name:

This field contains the name of the device, e.g. »LPS240S«.
This information is determined during initial start-up via
direct »Inquiry« from the device. In case no name could be
found, or the name makes no sense, you may alter the name. In
order to do so simply click the text gadget.

Version:

This field contains the release verion number of the device,
e.g. »1234.5678«. This information is determined during initial
start- up via direct »Inquiry« from the device. The version
number is usually also printed on the case of the device.

Size:

Size or memory capacity of the device is indicated in kilo- or
megabytes. One kilobyte corresponds to 1,024 bytes and one
megabyte corresponds to 1024 kilobytes. The actual size of the
device is calculated according to the number of blocks and the
size of each block. The number of blocks must be supplied by
the device according to SCSI standard specifications. In case
the device does not supply a value of the block size, the
controller will adapt 512 bytes as a standard value (please
also refer to Capacity/Block Size).

Please note that the value of the megabytes can differ from the
information supplied by the manufacturer. Many manufacturers of
harddisks define a megabyte differently. To their advantage
they define one megabyte with only 1000 kbyte, and this results
in a higher total capacity of megabytes.

2.8.2 Capacity

These are the physical values of a device. They do not
necessarily correspond to the actual capacity. Do not get
confused by values listed that can not be possible on first
sight. The values are ignored anyway.

Cylinders:

Basically a cylinder is one track. In case a device has several
heads, one cylinder consists of so many tracks, as the device
has heads.

Sectors:

As stated above a cylinder may consist of several tracks. The
number of sectors indicates the number of blocks per track.

Heads:

Number of heads of your harddisk. The number of heads
determines the number of tracks of a cylinder. The number of
tracks per cylinder is analogous to the number of heads.

Block Size:

The block size represents the fourth and last value for
determining the storage capacity of a device and its
partitions. The devices block size is determined via a direct
»Inquiry« by the program.

Usually a block on a harddisk is the size of 512 bytes. Sony
Magneto-Optical drives may have sizes of 512 bytes or 1024
bytes and CD-ROMS can even have 2 kilobytes per block. If the
device does not return a value upon »Inquiry«, the program uses
512 bytes as a default setting.

2.8.3 Control

The first three control flags »last unit:«, »last TID« and
»last LUN« are especially evaluated by the system programs upon
startup. The system programs read these three values and know
up to where they have to scan for devices. If a device is
specified as the last one, the scanning process stops with that
device and devices connected thereafter will not be mounted to
the system. Please not that this function is only supported by
the latest operating system versions.

last unit:

The program automatically sets the flag to the correct
position. It defines that the device that you are installing is
last device to be mounted to the system.

By setting this flag no further devices are mounted to the
system.

last TID:

The program automatically sets the flag to the correct
position. It defines that the device that you are installing is
last device of that controller, to be mounted to the system. Up
to seven devices may be connected to a SCSI-controller. If you
have only connected one harddisk, you can activate this flag.
This prevents the system programs from looking for other
additional devices upon booting and may save some time.

last LUN:

The program automatically sets the flag to the correct
position. This switch defines whether this is the last logical
unit of a or »in« a device.

Reselection:

Using RESELECTION you can define whether the controller should
accept and use the function Disconnect/Reconnect for this
device.

Synchronous:

Defines whether data should be transferred with a less explicit
protocol. This is not useful as the harddisks are already
operated at maximum data transfer rates.

Interleave:

The INTERLEAVE factor should always be »0«, except for Seagate
harddisks, which may require a different factor. The interleave
factor has influence on the drives' transfer rate.

A factor of »0« means that the device should use its own
default setting. Using factors »1« and higher you can determine
the interleave factor for the low level format.

In order for the factor to have any effect, you need to select
the item EXTRAS/LOW LEVEL FORMAT. Please note that all data on
the unit will then be deleted!

Auto park:

Using auto park you can set the time period after which the
harddisk should move to the parking position. This function is
especially useful if you do not work on your computer for a
long time, e.g. several days, while the computer is stilled
turned on. In case you work regularly on your computer, it is
recommended to set the value to »0«, i.e. to switch the auto
park function off. Minimum time period is 300 seconds. The
program does not accept shorter periods.

2.8.4 Pull Down Menu Paramter

The window, »Installation of Device« has its own pull down menu.

Inquiry:

This function determines the information and capacity of the
device upon request. The program sends the »Inquiry« command to
the device, which then returns the information.

Load:

Since the program is also suitable for installing devices
connected to IDE/AT-Bus controllers, you can use this function
to load preference settings. This is particularly useful, as
these devices return either wrong or insufficient data after an
»Inquiry« in most cases. The preference settings for various
devices are located on the disk in separate files.

After selecting PARAMETER/LOAD a file requester opens. Now you
can select the file with the suitable preference settings. The
name of the file corresponds to the name of the device.

Save:

This function is only supplied in order to give the
manufacturer the possibility to save files with preference
settings. Usually you will not need this function.

2.9 Partition Drive...

This function is only available, if you have selected the
manual mode. It lets you create and setup one or more
partitions. All values that need to be set here are saved on
the device in the »PartitionBlock« after the RDSK Block and are
evaluated during each startup of the computer by the driver and
the Amiga.

Use:

Click USE and all changes of data are adopted or maintained.
Finally these changes can be saved using the function SAVE
CHANGES TO DRIVE.

Cancel:

Use CANCEL in case you do not want to adopt or maintain the
changes made or you just peeked in and want to leave the window
without performing any changes. All changes made will be lost.

2.9.1 Available Partitions

This list displays all available partitions on the selected
device. The partitions are listed by their names and size in
megabyte.

You can select a partition from the list for editing. The
selected partition is also displayed in the line under the
list. Additionally the corresponding block, representing the
selected partition is highlighted in the overview.

Partitions are automatically set as close as possible by the
program, so that no space is left or wasted between the
individual partitions.

2.9.2 Overview

In the overview the individual partitions are displayed as
blocks in a bar which represents the capacity of the entire
device. You can select one partition by clicking a block in the
bar. The block will then be displayed in color, indicating the
active partition.

2.9.3    Add

The function ADD PARTITION adds a partition of maximum size to
the end of the device and appends it to the list. If there is
no free disk space at the end of the device, the function is
ghosted  and can not be selected. You must then supply
sufficient space by reducing or deleting another partition.

2.9.4    Edit

After clicking EDIT PARTITION you access the window including
all parameters of the selected partition. The description of
the parameters is given in the section »Edit Partition«. If no
partition is selected, this function is ghosted and can not be
selected. In that case you must first use the function ADD
PARTITION to partition a drive.

2.9.5    Delete

The function DELETE PARTITION deletes the active partition in
the list. Please note that the following partitions close the
gap and free disk space will be available at the end of the
device. In case there is no partition at all, this function is
ghosted and can not be selected.

2.10 Edit Partition...

This function cannot be accessed via the main window, but only
via the window »Partition drive...«.

Use:

When using the gadget USE, all changes of data are adopted or
maintained. Finally these changes may also be saved using the
function SAVE CHANGES TO DRIVE.

Cancel:

Use CANCEL in case you do not want to maintain or adopt any
changes made, or when you were just peeking and want to leave
the window without performing any changes. All changes are lost.

2.10.1 Name

In this field you can enter or change the name of the
partition. This name corresponds to the physical name of the
partition. You should therefore use »dh0:«, »dh1:« or similar
names. The names correspond to the names of floppy disk drives,
such as »df0:«.

2.10.2 Bytes

This informs you of the size of the partition in byte. The
program automatically calculates the size whenever you change
the number of cylinders.

2.10.3 Cylinder

Here you may enter the number of cylinders a partition should
consist of. This value defines the size of the partition. When
you change the size of a partition, all following partitions -
if applicable - are automatically moved accordingly, closing
any gaps.

In case the device does not have sufficient space for the
desired size of the partition, the program will automatically
reduce the number of cylinders to the maximum possible number.
If you still want to enlarge the active partition, you must
reduce the size of another partition, first.

2.10.4 StartCyl and EndCyl

These values indicate at which cylinder the partition begins
and which cylinder defines the end. Both values include the
cylinders given. If the StartCyl-value is 10, the partition
begins with cylinder 10 and not with 11.

2.10.5 Reserved

This value is usually set to »2« and should not be changed.
This value also depends on the used file system. It is
different for MS-DOS file systems. The value defines the number
of reserved blocks at the beginning of a partition, e.g. for
the boot program.

2.10.6 PreAlloc

This value is usually set to »0« and should not be changed. It
defines the number of reserved blocks at the end of the
partition.

2.10.7 File System

The cycle gadget »File system« offers the choice of several
file systems. The default setting is the »FFS«. The »DOSType«
is automatically changed by the program according to the chosen
file system. Each file system has its own specific DOSType.

This information defines which file system, installed in the
Amigas ROM or on the device should be used for the partition.
The allocation is done during the booting process of the Amiga.
Only if you have chosen the file system »Special«, you must
enter the »DOSType« yourself, e.g. »MSD\0« for the
»CrossDOSFileSystem«.

 Typ  File System              Name / Typ          OS Version

DOS\0 DOS          StandardFileSystem                 1.2
DOS\1 FFS          FastFileSystem                     1.3
DOS\2 DOS Inter    StandardFileSystem International   2.1
DOS\3 FFS Inter    FastFileSystem International       2.1
DOS\4 DOS DirCache StandardFileSystem Directory Cache 3.0
DOS\5 FFS DirCache FastFileSystem Directory Cache     3.0

2.10.8 DOSType

Here you can only enter a DOSType if you have chosen the file
system »Special«. In all other cases the entry field is
ghosted. The »DOSType« is stated in C-syntax.

2.10.9 Mask

Determines to which memory range of the Amiga the controller
may transfer data. This value is automatically set by the
program.

2.10.10 MaxTransfer

This value defines the maximum amount of byte the operating
system can request from the controller. The value is set
automatically by the program.

2.10.11 Automount

»Automount« defines whether a partition should be mounted to
the Amiga-system during the boot process. For example, you may
turn off the »Automount« and mount the partition manually later
on whenever necessary with the »c:Mount«-command and a
MountList- entry.

If »Automount« is disabled, you cannot change the values
»Bootable«, »Priority« and »Bootblocks«, as »Automount« is
necessary for these values to have any effect.

2.10.12 Bootable

»Bootable« lets you select whether you would like to boot from
this partition after starting up your computer. If »Automount«
is disabled for this partition, you cannot select »Bootable«.
In this case the gadget is also displayed ghosted.

2.10.13 Priority

The »Priority« states from which bootable partition the Amiga
should boot upon start up. The partition with the highest
priority is used in that case. The values may range from »-127«
to »+127«. If you enter »-1« the Amiga will boot from the
floppy disk, as the floppy disk drive has a priority of »5«.

2.10.14 Bootblocks

The program uses the default value »0«. Until now, a possible
»Bootprogram« is not supported by the controllers yet.

2.10.15 Buffers

Here you enter the size of the »Buffer« (Cache) that is used
for the data transfer. A buffer has the size of 512 byte. The
buffer is allocated in the main memory of the Amiga. You should
select the size of the buffer according to the amount of main
memory available. Please note that allocating large buffers for
many partitions is very memory consuming as all these buffers
are summed up.

2.10.16 Pull Down Menu Password/Install

Using this function you may set a password for a partition, as
well as access rights. Please note that the password is stored
together with the partition data in the RDSK Block. As the RDSK
Block is not designed for this kind of data, the RDSK Block
does not conform to the standard anymore. If you would like to
a have 100% standard RDSK Block, you should not install a
password or delete an existing password with PASSWORD/DELETE.

Password protection is only available with Elaborate Bytes
ALF and bsc/ALfaData Oktagon and AT-Bus controllers.

Please also refer to the description of »MountHD« in the
chapter »Utilities«.

Access rights without password (Public):

This defines the access rights for the partition that you or
other users have, if a password was not entered at boot time.

No Access:

You have absolutely no access to the partition. If the user did
not enter a password, the user will never actually see the
partition as it isn't even mounted during start up.

Read:

The partition is mounted to the system and may be read from.

Write, Read:

The partition may be read and written to.

Format, Write, Read:

The partition may be read, written to and formatted.

Access rights with password (Protected):

Here you select the rights of users that have entered the
correct password.

No Access:

This option is disabled, as you have to allow at least for
reading access. A user that entered the correct password will
always be able to read the partition. Anything else would not
make sense.

Read:

The partition is mounted to the system and may be read from.

Write, Read:

The partition may be read and written to.

Format, Write, Read:

The partition may be read, written to and formatted.

Password:

Enter a password consisting of a maximum of eight characters.
Please note that the program is case sensitive, i.e.
distinguishes between upper and lower case letters.

Use:

The gadget USE adopts or maintains data changed. Finally you
may also save the changes to your device using SAVE CHANGES TO
DRIVE.

Cancel:

If you do not wish to adopt or maintain the changes made, or if
you were just peeking and would like to quit the window without
keeping the changes, please select CANCEL. All changes are lost.

2.10.17 Pull Down Menu Password/Delete

This function erases the existing password information after a
confirmation by the user. This enables you to simply erase
password settings and restore the RDSK Block to its standard
form.

2.11 File System

This function is only available if you are working in the
manual mode. Otherwise the gadget is disabled and ghosted. The
function FILE SYSTEM gives you the opportunity to load a
specific file management system, prepare it for saving on a
device and use it for partitions.

Use:

The gadget USE adopts or maintains data changed. Finally you
may also save the changes to your device using SAVE CHANGES TO
DRIVE.

Cancel:

If you do not wish to adopt or maintain the changes made, or if
you were just peeking and would like to quit the window without
keeping the changes, please select CANCEL. All changes are lost.

2.11.1   Available File Systems

All listed file systems including the device and partition data
are saved on the device. This is only necessary when you want
to use a file system for one or several partitions which are
not included in the Amigas ROM.

The »FastFileSystem« is included in Kickstart 2.0 ROM, but not
in the Kickstart 1.3 or 1.2 ROMs. If you would like to operate
a partition with »FastFileSystem« under Kickstart 1.3 you must
add »FastFileSystem« to the list. The list not only shows the
name of the file system, but also its size, version and
DOSType. The »FastFileSystem« of later operating systems
starting with release 2.0 also include the
»StandardFileSystem«, as well as some »International«- and
»DirectoryCache«-variations starting with operating systems
3.0. Therefore you' ll need to load the »FastFileSystem« only
once for the file systems ranging from »DOS\0« to partially
»DOS\5«.

DOSType:

This information identifies the file system.

Version:

This displays the version and revision number of the file
system. The number given in the version field actually consists
of two parts. The number before the period indicates the
version the number thereafter the revision number. Since
Commodore did not determine a standard for this value it may
occur that the version number is incorrect or unusable. In that
case you can either change the entry or enter it using UPDATE.
This is not possible later, though.

Size:

Since the version number of some file systems can and/or could
not always be identified to full satisfaction, the file system
may also be distinguished by their file size. Their size is
given in byte.

Name / Type:

In most cases this is the name of a file system under which it
is also saved on disk. Depending on the DOSType they may also
be different.

The later versions of »FastFileSystems« know for example
several DOSTypes. When adding or replacing the »FastFileSystem«
with »DOS\3«, »FastFileSystem International« will appear in the
list.

2.11.2 Add

After clicking ADD a file requester opens where you can enter
the name of a new file system. In the Add File System window
you can then change or correct the DOSType, version number and
the size.

2.11.3 Update

With UPDATE you can replace an already existing file system by
another one, e.g. a later version (see ADD). After clicking ADD
a file requester opens where you can enter the name of a new
file system. In the Add File System window you can then change
or correct the DOSType, version number and the size.

2.11.4 Delete

With DELETE you can delete the selected file system. It will
not be saved on the file system any longer.

2.11.5 Add File System Window

Use:

Click USE and all changes of data are adopted or maintained.
Finally these changes can be saved using the function SAVE
CHANGES TO DRIVE.

Cancel:

Use CANCEL in case you do not want to adopt or maintain the
changes made or you just peeked in and want to leave the window
without performing any changes. All changes made will be lost.

Name:

Enter the path and file name of the file system which you would
like to install on the device. Of course this is only possible,
if the file system is available as a file, e.g. the
»FastFileSystem« in the »l:«-directory.

DOSType:

2.12 Save Changes To Drive

This function finally saves all changes performed by the
functions SETUP DRIVE, PARTITION DRIVE and FILE SYSTEM to the
RDSK Block on the unit.

Before these settings are saved you will be asked for
confirmation. All previously existing data will then be lost.
In case you have previously installed your harddisk and have
now changed the partition data, the Amiga will only find the
new partitions and not the old ones after a reset.

When the program has completed writing the data, it will inform
you and ask you whether you would like to reboot your Amiga to
activate the new settings. Click REBOOT. A reboot is especially
necessary when you have changed partitions on an already
installed harddisk, as the old partitions are still mounted to
the system. If you would now mount the new partitions with
»MountHD« or the function DOS FORMAT in this program your
Amiga could not cope with this situation. The Amiga will then
try to work with different partitions on the same harddisk,
which will not work in the long run.

In case you are installing your harddisk for the first time,
you may click CANCEL and continue with the function DOS FORMAT.

2.13 DOS Format

With this function partitions are formatted for use with
AmigaDOS. As a rule you have to format all partitions with DOS.
You may use this function only when a partition exists on the
selected device and you are in the manual mode.

You do not necessarily have to use this program for formatting.
You may also format these partitions from the Workbench or
CLI/Shell as you would format a normal floppy disk. In
Workbench 2.0 the function used to format is called
ICONS/FORMAT DISK... . In the CLI/Shell you have to use the
command »sys:system/format«. We have integrated this function
in our program in order to make the installation easier for
unexperienced users.

If you want to use a special data management system (file
system) and with that a special DOSType for the partition, you
cannot use this program. This program supports only the
standard types.

Cancel:

If you are done formatting, or if you were just peeking, you
can leave the function and the window by clicking CANCEL.

2.13.1 Available Partitions

A list of all partitions available on the selected drive is
displayed. To select a partition, click it in the list and it
will be highlighted.

2.13.2 New Volume Name

Enter the name of the partition in this field. The name will be
shown on the Workbench under the respective icon, just like the
icon of a floppy disk.

2.13.3 Trashcan

If you select this checkmark gadget a trashcan will be added to
your partition after formatting. The program will try to copy
the trashcan from the »sys:«-directory or, if that does not
exist, it will copy the trashcan saved in the program.

2.13.4 Verify

When checked, the program will search for errors that occurred
during the formatting of the partition. This feature will not
work, if you select QUICK FORMAT.

2.13.5 File System

Here you may assign a file system to the partition, absolutely
independent from the settings of the partition.

After starting your Amiga the controller will first read the
partition data with the assigned DOSType. Then it will search
for a file system of the same DOSType, load and start it.
Finally the file system checks the partition itself for which
file system the partition was formatted. It is possible that a
file system supports different systems, e.g. »FastFileSystem«
»DOS\0« up to »DOS\5«.

2.13.6 Format

After clicking FORMAT you are asked to confirm your choice for
safety reasons one last time, as all data on your device will
be lost. Once the partition is formatted you can work with it
and copy for example files, programs and data to your partition.

2.13.7 Quick Format

This type of formatting does the same as FORMAT, just a little
faster but less safe. Only essential structures will be written
to the partition and not the complete formatting information.
The partition will not be checked for errors either, even if
you selected the VERIFY checkmark gadget.

2.14 Copy Disks

Using this function you can copy the contents of a file or a
device to a partition. You may also copy the contents of a disk
from the CLI to a partition using the command »c:copy«. The
program contains the COPY DISKS function in order to help the
unexperienced user to copy a Workbench to the partition without
having to go into the details of the CLI/Shell.

Cancel:

If you are done copying, or if you were just peeking and would
like to leave this function and close the window, click CANCEL.

2.14.1 From Drive

Here you select the medium from which the data is to be copied,
e.g. a Workbench disk. The selected device or drive is
highlighted.

2.14.2 To Drive

Here you select the partition to which the contents of the
drive selected above should be copied to. The selected
partition is highlighted.

2.14.3 Copy

Click COPY... to start the process. Please note that you cannot
interrupt this operation.

2.14.4 List Files

This function opens a file requester enabling you to look at
the contents of the device.

2.15 Extras/Low Level Format...

This function formats a drive physically. It is completely
different from the DOS format.

The low level formatting is the precondition for storing data
on a storage medium. Blocks and tracks, e.g. on the harddisk
are created to store a certain amount of bytes. When
DOS-formatting, the Amigas operating system creates its own
file management structure. This file management structure and
the files are stored together as data on the device in the
created blocks.

After low level formatting a specific amount of memory blocks
are available on the drive. Only after DOS-formatting the drive
you can create files and directories on the Workbench or in the
CLI, name files, store files in subdirectories, etc.

In recent years the low level formatting is already performed
by the manufacturer of the device. Therfore you will not need
to low level format your device. Low level formatting will
rarely be necessary, only when for example you are having
difficulties with the installation or other major problems
occur.

First select the device to be formatted from the list of
available devices in the main window. Then select the function.
Please note that all data on the device will be erased due to
the formatting process.

While the window »Low Level Format« is open, you cannot access
any other function in the main window of the program. All
functions are ghosted.

Cancel:

When you are done formatting, or if you were just peeking and
would like to leave this function and close the window, please
click CANCEL.

2.15.1 Drive

Displays the drives name and manufacturer to avoid a mix up of
drives, if you have connected more than one. Please make sure
you really selected the correct one!

2.15.2 Interleave

The INTERLEAVE-factor should always be »0«, except for Seagate
harddisks, which may require a different factor. The interleave
factor has influence on the drives' transfer rate.

A factor of »0« means that the device should use its own
default setting. Using factors »1« and higher you can determine
the interleave factor for the low level format.

This value is also used for SETUP DRIVE, but has no actual
effect in that function.

2.15.3 Block Size

The devices block size is determined via a direct »Inquiry« by
the program.

Usually a block on a harddisk is the size of 512 bytes. Sony
Magneto-Optical drives may have sizes of 512 bytes or 1024
bytes and CD-ROMS can even have 2 kilobytes per block. If the
device does not return a value upon »Inquiry«, the program uses
512 bytes as a default setting.

2.15.4 Ignore Grown Defects

Clicking the checkmark gadget IGNORE GROWN DEFECTS you can
determine, whether all blocks listes as defective shall be
reused. Generally you should leave this function off.

2.15.5 Format

After clicking FORMAT a panel appears asking for your
confirmation before the selected device is formatted. The
formatting process cannot be interrupted until it is completely
done. Please note that all data on the device is erased in the
formatting process. As soon as the device is completely
formatted it may be set up, using the program.

2.16 Extras / Check Drive...

Checks your harddisks for possible errors. When errors are
detected, this does not necessarily mean that data is lost.
Harddisks have a mechanism for repairing minor defects so they
will not occur. Using the CHECK DRIVE command this mechanism is
deactivated and therefore even the smallest errors on the
harddisk are detected.

While the window CHECK DRIVE is open, you cannot access any
other function in the main window. All functions are ghosted.

Cancel:

As soon as you are done checking your harddisk or if you were
just peeking and would like to leave this function and close
the window now, please click CANCEL.

2.16.1 Errors Found

All errors found during the check are displayed in this list.
If you select REASSIGN these blocks will be reassigned.

2.16.2 Number of Checks

Here you determine the number of time the harddisk is checked
subsequently. Usually the harddisk is checked only once. If you
are certain though, that an error occurs only seldomly you can
enter a higher value, for example 100. However, this may take
an entire night.

All errors found in the test cycles are added to the list.

2.16.3 Check

Select CHECK to start the process. If errors are found they
will be displayed in the »errors found« list.

When you call up this function, a window opens and informs you
that the harddisk is now being checked and the cycle number is
also displayed.

Please note that you cannot interrupt this function. Only if
you have entered several checks, you can interrupt the
operation between two check cycles.

While CHECK is running, you cannot access any other function in
the main window. All functions are ghosted.

2.16.4 Clear List

Deletes all entries from the »errors found« list.

2.16.5 Reassign

SCSI-devices can reassign bad blocks without a loss of data of
capacity. Data stored in a bad block is written to another
block and a reference to the good block is saved in the bad
block. The new block is located in a section of the harddisk
especially reserved for these cases. This section is not
available for normal operation.

The function REASSIGN initiates the reassignment of bad blocks.
This operation cannot be interrupted. As soon as the
reassignment process is completed, you return to the main
window and the window CHECK DRIVE is closed.

2.17 Extras / Rigid Disk Blocks

With this function you can manage the system information of the
harddisk. The following functions all refer to the device
selected in the »Devices in System« in the main window. Please
make sure that you always select the correct device.

2.17.1 Load from File

When selecting RIGID DISK BLOCKS/LOAD FROM FILE... a file
requester opens, from which you may select a file. The file
will be loaded into the RDSK Block structur in the RAM. Then
you can write the data from RAM to the harddisk with SAVE
CHANGES TO DRIVE in the main window.

This function is especially helpful, when the system
information on the harddisk was lost, e.g. when it was
accidentally overwritten by another program. In this case you
can load the RDSK Block, which you previously stored on a disk,
and write it to the harddisk. That's all you need to do to
repair your harddisk. In case you don't have a copy of the RDSK
Block on disk you'll have to think hard to remember the
position your partitions. So, always keep a copy of the RDSK
Block in a safe place.

2.17.2 Save to File

Saves the RDSK Block to a file. A file requester appears and
you can choose the filename and directory. You should select a
floppy disk, as destination as the information would be useless
in case of a harddisk problem. You'll also need the program on
disk in the worst of all cases.

2.17.3 Erase

This command will erase the RDSK Block. It will create a
»virgin«, i.e. uninstalled harddisk. This function is to be
used with greatest care, as the entire installation and the
data of the harddisk is lost irrevocably.

First you will be asked whether you really want to continue.
Then the RDSK Block is deleted from RAM. With SAVE CHANGES TO
THE DRIVE in the main window you may save the changes to the
harddisk. This function doesn't actually erase the RDSK Block
completely, but makes it unreadable for the system programs and
for the operating system. Consequently, the operating system
assumes that the harddisk has not yet been installed.

2.18 Configure Controller

These functions are only available for the controllers Oktagon
508, 2000 or A.L.F. 3 or Oktagon 2008, as these have a special
configuration memory. This memory allows for saving the
configuration parameters in a memory buffer that is never lost,
even after turning off your computer.
This is not available with the AT-Bus 2008 or the Tandem
controllers!
Configure controller is only available if you are running Kickstart
version 1.3. With Kickstart 2.04 or better, please use the program
OktagonPrefs.

2.19 ToolTypes

The program stores its own environment parameters under
ToolTypes. You access ToolTypes by selecting the programs icon
on the Workbench and calling up INFO or INFORMATION in the pull
down menu of the Workbench. A window appears with the text
gadget »ToolType«.

2.19.1 Device

The program tries to find devices by the means of the installed
driver. The program uses the driver name »oktagon.device« as a
default, if you haven't entered anything else in ToolTypes yet.
Selecting PROJECT/INFO displays which driver is selected. Since
the program is case-sensitive please mind the correct spelling
and do not forget the extenstion ».device«.

Examples:

DEVICE=ALF.device
DEVICE=scsi.device
DEVICE=oktagon.device

If the program cannot find the chosen driver in the system, you
will be informed by a panel when starting the program. This
message is displayed even before the main window appears. Click
OK to quit the program. Then check, why the driver name could
not be found. Either your controller is defective or the driver
name is incorrect.

2.19.2 Language

You should change this setting from the program via the pull
down menu SETTINGS/LANGUAGE which are then saved in the
ToolTypes. The default language is English, if nothing is
displayed in the ToolTypes.

2.19.3 MAXLUN, MAXPIC, MAXTID

MAXLUN sets the highest logical unit number to search for.
The default is 9.

MAXPIC sets the highest board number to search for.
The default is 7.

MAXTID sets the highest target id number to search for.
The default is 9.

Using PROJECT/INFO from the program will inform you about the
actual settings.

2.19.4 Mode

You should make these settings via the programs' pull down menu
SETTINGS/MODE. Using SETTINGS/Save the selected mode is saved
in the ToolTypes. The program uses the default setting
»automatically« if no setting is stated in the ToolTypes.

2.19.5 RDBLOW

Here you can specify, where the RDB should be created, if no
valid RDB is on the disk. The default is 0, valid values are
0 to 15.

This can be helpful, if you wish to have a shared MS-DOS and
Amiga drive.

Example:

RDBLOW=2

will write the RDB into sector 2.

Using PROJECT/INFO from the program will inform you about the
actual setting.

2.19.6 RDBSPACE

Here you can specify, how much space should be reserved when a new
RDB is created (in kBytes),
The default is 256.

This space can be used for filesystems and drive init code like
Oktapussy.

Example:

RDBSPACE=256

will reserve 256 kBytes for rigid disk blocks.

Using PROJECT/INFO from the program will inform you about the
actual setting.
