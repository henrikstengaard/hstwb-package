Connecting MS-DOS Formatted Drives
==================================

The  MS-DOS  program  MSDOSMount  is a utility program which allows volumes
formatted with an MSDOS compatible partition sector, to be addressed like a
normal AmigaDos disk drive on the AMIGA.

As  a  prerequisite  for using the program, the CROSSDOS filesystem must be
located  in  the L directory of the boot drive.  The CROSSDOS filesystem is
supplied  with  Workbench  3.x  and  should  already  be  located in the L:
directory  in  standard  installation.  If this is not the case then please
copy  the appropriate data file from the installation diskette to your hard
disk.

The MSDOSMount program can now be started from the Shell by giving the Unit
Number to be connected (the SCSI-ID of the device which should be connected
as MSDOS formatted volume):

	1> MSDOSMount <devicename> <unit>

if,  as in this example, the MSDOS formatted volume has the SCSI-ID 3.  The
current  Version  0.91 issues different values which have no meaning to the
user  and  which  are  processed  further  in a graphical user interface in
Version 1.0, to demonstrate possible faults.

With  removable  media, MSDOSMount automatically recognises if a new medium
has  been  inserted  with  the  same  geometry  as the mounted medium.  If,
however,  you  use  a  medium  that  displays another geometry (e.g.  other
partitions) then MSDOS must be re-executed.

Due  to  the  numerous  possible format parameters of MSDOS computers it is
unfortunately not possible to format the volumes on the Amiga.  If you want
to  work  with  the  MSDOSMount program for data exchange, the volume to be
used  must  be  partitioned  on  an MSDOS compatible target system with the
program  FDISK  (check  in  the  appropriate  MSDOS documentation) and then
formatted under MSDOS.
