                                SCSIConfig
                               -------------

SCSIConfig  allows  you  to format and partition SCSI-devices, such as hard
disks  or removable drives, and to make them available to the system.  Open
SCSIConfig by double-clicking on the appropriate icon.

The  options for personally configuring your system are explained in detail
in  the  following  section.   Connecting  hard  disks already operating on
another  controller to your Amiga and data-loss are described in a separate
section.   If  you want to use disk drives already being used by the Amiga,
you should read this section before experimenting.

HDToolBox,  which is delivered as part of the Operating System, may be used
instead  of  SCSIConfig.   This may be useful especially if SCSIConfig does
not  correctly  recognize  partitions  on disk drives that were already RDB
formatted   by   an   alternate  controller.   Please  refer  also  to  the
step-by-step   instructions.    Since   HDToolBox  uses  the  internal  IDE
controller  as default it has to be startet from the shell with the correct
devicename in order to make it operate on the SCSI controller.

The syntax used is:

	1> hdtoolbox DEVICENAME



Both SCSIConfig and HDToolbox are programs which format hard disks or other
SCSI-devices.   Formatting  means a complete loss of data, which is why you
must   proceed   carefully   with   these   programs   and  not  experiment
unnecessarily.    Always   check   that   you  have  selected  the  correct
SCSI-device,  before  executing destructive steps such as new-formatting or
partitioning.   If  you  want  to  connect  disk  drives  which are already
operating  on  another controller and which contain data, then for security
reasons,  we  strongly advise backing-up the hard drive BEFORE removing the
old  system.   Each  new  connection  of a hard disk which is already being
used, involves a risk (even if it is very small) of data loss due to errors
in the installation or commissioning.  If it would take too long to back-up
the  data onto diskettes because of the large amount of data, then ask your
dealer  whether he can carry out the back-ups (e.g.  on a streamer) and new
installation  for  you,  or  whether  you  can  rent a streamer, at a small
charge.   We  accept  no  liability  for loss of data on hard disks or SCSI
devices used prior to being connected to th SCSI Controller.


 additional information
-------------------------

Start  SCSIConfig  by  double-clicking  on  the  SCSIConfig  icon  and  the
following main window will be opened:

This window contains the two truly "dangerous" buttons which must always be
handled  with care:  "Save Changes" and "LowLevelFormat".  This is why they
are dealt with right at the start of this section.

All  alterations  which  you make to one of the other windows, will only be
written  to  the  disk  drive  with  "Save  Changes".   If you have changed
partition  data  or  disk  drive data, the old settings will be permanently
lost  by  writing the new values to the disk drive.  In many cases changing
this  data  results  in  the  loss  of  all  the  data  files stored on the
partitions concerned or the partitions themselves.

The  "LowLevelFormat"  function  physically formats the disk drive.  If you
execute  this  command, all the data stored on the disk drive will be lost.
Nearly all SCSI disk drives no longer need to be Low-Level formatted by the
user, as these drives are already physically formatted by the manufacturer.
In  general,  it  is  only  necessary  to  physically  format new media for
removable disk drives.

As  both  the  "LowLevelFormat"  and  "Save  Changes"  functions  can  have
destructive  effects,  as  described, they are both protected against being
activated  by  mistake with two security steps.  You can stop the procedure
once  it has been started by using CANCEL.  If you confirm the procedure by
clicking  on OK in the second security step, the function will be executed,
without fail.

Now,  back  to  the  description  of  SCSIConfig.  In the upper part of the
window  there  are  two  lists.   The right-hand list displays all the SCSI
Controllers  installed  on  your system, while the left-hand list shows all
the devices connected to the controller selected.  The buttons in the lower
portion  of  the  window execute various functions or open further windows.
The  functions  are  always  executed  on  the device selected in the upper
portion.   To  select a device, click once on the appropriate device, which
will then change color.

When you have selected the device, you can then apply the various functions
described  below,  to  the  device.  Please note that not all functions are
applicable to all devices.  For example, a CD-ROM cannot be reconfigured in
ConfigDrive and SCSIConfig displays a message to this effect.

Available gadgets are:

*** Config Drive

The  ConfigDrive  window,  which  appears  when  the  ConfigDrive button is
activated,  is  used to inform the system of the drive data.  Theoretically
you  can  take all the values here from the datasheet of your hard disk and
type  them  in manually but this is normally not the case.  To save you the
work  and  to avoid errors, the "Reload Geometry" button has been provided.
Click  on  this  button and the drive data will be read so that the program
can  investigate  a  suitable  geometry.  This procedure is recommended for
drives  which  have  never  been  used  on  an  Amiga  before.   The values
investigated  by  the  program  will then be transferred to the appropriate
fields.   The  values  produced  by  SCSIConfig  may  be different from the
figures  on  the  datasheet  for  the SCSI device.  This is normal, as SCSI
devices  are  "intelligent" and the parameters are automatically translated
correctly.   You  therefore  need not, and in fact cannot, alter any of the
values  read  in  by  "Reload  Geometry",  as  you will otherwise alter the
format-management within the drive.

Do  not  use  Reload Geometry on drives which have already been used on the
Amiga,  as  these  are  established in the geometry defined in the RDB.  If
this  geometry  is  altered  by Reload Geometry, this will cause a complete
loss  of  data.   If you want to use a drive already formatted on the Amiga
which  cannot be automatically connected, you must use the geometry already
determined in the RDB by means of Reload RDB.

With  Reload RDB you can reload the drive data which is stored in the Rigid
Disk  Block.   This is sensible if you have made changes to the entries and
want  to  cancel them or for connecting hard disks already formatted by the
Amiga,  whose  RDB is not correctly recognised.  Finally, this function may
be  required  for older RDB's where the most important details are correct,
but  not  all  the information is available for automatic connection of the
drive  under  AMIGA-DOS  3.0.  By reading with Reload RDB and rewriting the
RDB  via  Save Changes WITHOUT altering the size settings, this data can be
updated  to  the  latest version.  This procedure is only to be used when a
hard disk which is already RDB formatted is not automatically recognised on
SCSI Controller.

The  Load  Device and Delete Device buttons are used to bring in updates to
device  drivers.   When  phase  5  publishes  a  new  driver,  it  will  be
accompanied  by  special  instructions for using these buttons.  Neither of
these buttons are used at this moment in time.

The two checkboxes "Synchron" and "Reselection" allow you to specify that a
hard  disk  or  another  SCSI  device  is to be automatically switched into
Synchronous  or  Reselection mode at system start-up.  You can change these
settings  and  store  the  changes  in  the  main window without losing the
existing  data.   For  the meanings and advantages and disadvantages of the
operation modes, please read the description of UnitControl.


*** Information

This button calls up various device data of the selected device.

On  the  right-hand  side there is a selection window, where you can select
the  type  of  information to be displayed (the so-called ModeSense-Pages).
Not  all  SCSI  devices return the same values to a request, so information
offered to you here depends on the device.  Select an information title and
the  corresponding  parameters  will be displayed in the left portion.  You
cannot  alter  any  data  here.  The information given is generally only of
interest  to  specialists  and  is  not  used in the daily operation of the
devices.

*** LowLevelFormat

This  executes  the  physical  formatting  of the device selected.  As this
operation  definitely  deletes all data stored on the device, including the
partition  information, two security steps take place before this operation
is  executed.   You  can terminate the execution of the Low-Level-Format by
activating  the  CANCEL  button.   A Low-Level-Format can take an extremely
long  time,  depending  on  the  type,  size  and  speed  of the hard disk;
formatting  times  of  several  hours  are by no means unusual.  As already
explained,  it  is  generally not necessary to Low-Level-Format hard disks;
this is mainly required for removable drives or optical disks.

Interrupting  a  LowLevelFormat could damage the data on the drive, so that
it  is  no longer possible to address it.  The internal administration data
on  the drive can be destroyed by interrupting the Low-Level-Format, so the
drive  no  longer  reacts  to  SCSI commands or returns totally nonsensical
values.   You  should,  therefore,  NEVER interrupt a Low-Level-Format by a
system reset or any other method.

We  also  advise  you  that  a  Low-level-Format  is  a totally destructive
measure,  which  will  definitely cause a complete loss of data.  Apply the
Low-Level-Format only to completely new SCSI devices or those which you are
sure contain no data.

*** Partition Drive

Partition  Drive  informs  the  system  how  the logical drive (partitions)
should be created on a disk drive.  It makes little sense to further divide
up  small  drives  or  removable media.  With larger disks, however, it can
definitely  be  sensible  to  set  up  several logical drives.  It can, for
example,  also  be advantageous to divide a disk so that one partition only
contains  data  of  a  particular  type,  if this data is often written and
altered.  Furthermore, individual partitions can be operated with different
filesystems,  which  can  also  be  determined  in  the  partition menu.  A
filesystem  represents  the communication between the device driver and the
operating   system.   It  translates  the  data-oriented  commands  of  the
operating  system  into the block-oriented commands for the driver.  Common
filesystems  are,  for  example,  the PC-compatible Cross-DOS-Filesystem or
special  emulator  filesystems.   For  general  AMIGA  applications  it  is
generally advisable to use FFS (Fast FileSystem).

In the left portion of the window you will see the partitions set up on the
device  selected and in the right portion the filesystems available.  Under
each  of the selection lists there is a button for adding a new entry ("Add
Partition"  and  "Add  Filesystem")  and  one for deleting a selected entry
("Delete  Partition"  and  "Delete Filesystem").  You can process any entry
simply by double clicking on it.

When  first setting up a drive which has previously not been RDB formatted,
SCSIConfig  automatically produces a partition called "QDH0" which includes
the  whole drive.  If you want to produce several partitions you must alter
this  partition by reducing the values for End Cyl., Total Cyl.  or MBytes.
Exit  from  the  partition  window  by  clicking on "OK" and then produce a
further   partition   by   activating  the  "Add  Partition"  button  which
automatically takes up all the free space on the hard disk.  Naturally, you
can  also  reduce  this  further to produce another partition and so forth.
You can produce any number of partitions in this way.

Advice  about partitioning:  First, note that each partition uses a certain
amount  of the main memory depending on the choice of the buffer size:  too
many  partitions,  especially  with  large  buffers,  can therefore clearly
reduce  the  available  memory  (you  can  always  fit  more on FASTLANE if
required).  Secondly, note that due to hard disk technology, the partitions
which  use  the  "lower numbered" tracks on the hard disk (those physically
located  on  the  outside  of  the  disk)  are,  in general, faster.  As an
example,  if  a  disk with 100,000 cylinders is divided into two partitions
then  the  partition  which  extends from track 2 to track 50,000 is faster
than  the partition from tracks 50,001 to 99,999.  This difference in speed
between  the  outer and inner tracks of a hard disk can amount to more than
50 %.  Common practice is to make the lower partition bootable and a system
partition.  As this is not absolutely necessary, however, you should decide
which  data you want fastest access to.  For example, it may be sensible to
place  the  system  partition  with  the  multimedia program (which is only
loaded  once),  on the inside and the animation data which needs to be read
quickly and often, on the outside.

*** The Partition Window

The  upper  part  of  the window contains an input window for the partition
data  and  the lower part contains the data for the other partitions of the
selected drive.  The input fields available are explained in detail below.

*** Name

The  name  with  which  the partition can be addressed.  This is the device
name,  not the volume name.  For comparison:  the device name of the floppy
disk  drive  is  always  "df0:".   The  volume name depends on the diskette
inserted  and  can  be  changed with the AMIGA-DOS command "relabel" or via
Workbench.   The  default setting on new drives is "QDH0".  As long as this
name  is  not  already allocated to another drive there is no reason why it
should be changed.  Please note that names allocated twice can cause system
conflicts and, consequently, loss of data.


*** Start Cyl.

This  value  indicates  the  beginning  of the partition to the drive.  The
lowest  tracks (cylinder) of a hard disk (usually two) are required for the
RDB so this value can never be zero.


*** End Cyl.

This value indicates the end of the partition on the drive.


*** Total Cyl.

This value indicates the total number of tracks in the partition.

*** MBytes

This value indicates the size of the partition in Megabytes.

The  four fields above are interdependent.  Inputting a value in one of the
fields  will  cause  the  others  to  be  recalculated automatically.  When
partitioning,  the  most  sensible  method  is  to  change  the size of the
partitions  via the MBytes field.  SCSIConfig then automatically calculates
the correct track limits for the partitions.


*** Identifier

The  identifier  area  contains  a  button  and an input field.  The button
allows  you  to  select the identifier of the filesystem to be used for the
partition.   If,  as  is  mostly  the case, a partition is to be used under
AMIGA-DOS, then only the default FFS (Fast FileSystem) should be selected.

The predefined identifiers available are OFS, FFS, OFS Int, DCFS, DCFS Int,
MSDOS0,  MSDOS1  and  Custom.   All  filesystems,  excluding Custom, have a
defined  identifier value, which cannot be modified.  If you have connected
a  new  filesystem  via  the "Add Filesystem" function you can assign it an
identifier in the filesystem window.  The filesystem concerned will then be
automatically  started  and  partitions  which have entered this identifier
will  be  operated  with  the appropriate filesystem.  Please also read the
information under "Filesystem and the Filesystem Window".


*** BlockSize

This  cycle  button  allows you to choose a different block size other than
512  Byte  for  the partition concerned.  This setting changes the internal
block  size  of  the z3scsi-driver, not the physical block size of the hard
disk.  An increase in the block size can have speed advantages depending on
the hard disk, especially when loading and storing small data files.


*** Mask

This  value  indicates  which  area  of the memory of the controller can be
directly  accessed.   As  the  controller  can directly access the complete
address area of the processor and a transmission should always be delivered
in  longword limits, the value pre-set by SCSIConfig of "0xFFFFFFFC" should
not  be  changed  as  this  will  cause  a significant decrease of the data
transfer speed.



*** MaxTransfer

This value limits the maximum amount of data which can be transmitted.  The
default value of "0xFFFFFF" should not be changed.


If  RDB  formatted  hard disks are to be used that were used by other AMIGA
controllers,  it  is  very  likely  that  the  Mask  value  will not be set
correctly  for  optimal Zorro-III operation (in general, it would have been
set at "0xFFFFFE"), which causes considerable data loss.  In this case, the
MASK  value for the existing partitions must be changed to the "0xFFFFFFFC"
stated  above.  Check that ONLY the Mask and MaxTransfer values are changed
as  changes  to  other  partition  details can cause data to be lost on the
partition.


*** Mount

If the box is checked then the partition will be automatically connected at
system start-up so that the appropriate icon appears on Workbench.


*** Boot

If  the box is checked this marks the partition as bootable.  The partition
which is booted depends on the priority.  The volume which is allocated the
highest priority and is available will be booted.


*** Priority

Input the desired boot priority here.  The boot priority is a value between
-128  and 127, which determines from which device the system will boot.  If
more  than  one bootable device is connected, the system will boot from the
device  that has the highest boot priority.  If the boot priority of a hard
drive  partition  is  higher than that of the floppy drive, the system will
boot  from  that  hard  drive,  even  if a bootable disk is inserted in the
flüoppy drive.


*** Reserved Low Blocks
*** Reserved High Blocks

These  fields  indicate  how  many  blocks  are  not  used  for data at the
beginning  and  end of the partition.  These values are "2" and "0" for the
standard  Amiga  filesystem  but  can  be  different for other filesystems.
Please read the documentation for the filesystem, if necessary.


*** Buffers

This  value determines how many blocks are kept in the memory to accelerate
the  disk  access.   On  every  read  and  write  access,  the  blocks  are
temporarily stored in these buffers so that they are available more quickly
when  reaccessed.   The  default  setting  for  the  buffer is 32, which is
definitely  sufficient for partitions up to approx.  100 MByte; with larger
partitions it may be sensible to increase the buffer sizes accordingly.  If
a  partition  validates too often it can be a sign that the buffers are too
small.


*** Filesystems and the Filesystem window

Other  filesystems,  apart from those available in the computer ROM, can be
loaded   via  the  "Add  Filesystem"  function.   Examples  are  an  MS-DOS
compatible  filesystem  or  an  emulator  filesystem.   After  loading, the
filesystem  must  be  allocated  an  internal  identifier;  all  partitions
assigned  this  identifier will then be operated with this filesystem.  The
filesystem  will  be  stored  with  the RDB in SCSIConfig and automatically
started  from (z3|cyb|2060|1230)scsi.device, if a partition is connected at
system start-up which has the corresponding identifier entry.

If you have loaded a filesystem via "Add Filesystem", the filesystem-window
opens  automatically  for  you  to  make  various assignments, as described
below.


*** Identifier

Here  you  chose  an  identifier  not  used  by  any other filesystem.  The
identifier is the system-internal identification of the filesystem.  If you
load an MS-DOS compatible filesystem, for example, give this filesystem the
identifier  MSDOS0  and  assign  the  same identifier for a partition which
should operate with this filesystem.


*** Version/Revision

These values are automatically taken from the filesystem.  If more than one
filesystem  is  assigned  the  same identifier then the filesystem with the
highest version/revision number will automatically be used.


*** Stacksize

If  required,  take  the  value  from  the documentation for the filesystem
loaded.


*** Priority

Should  always  stay at 0 or it will cause problems in the interaction with
other filesystems.

*** Patchflags

The values entered here should not be altered.

*** Load FileSystem

This  opens  the  data  file  requester  for  selecting  or loading another
filesystem to overwrite the current entry.

*** Save FileSystem

This  allows  you to save the filesystem selected in the current entry to a
diskette or hard disk.  This is sensible if you want to produce a back-up.




*** Connecting a Disk Drive Already Used on the Amiga

In  most  cases  the  system  will  recognise a disk drive which is already
formatted  once it is connected, because almost all SCSI-Controllers on the
market now support RDB.  Should your disk drive not be recognised, although
the  old controller was RDB-compatible, it could be that it has created the
RDB  in  a  different manner than is usual.  In this case it is possible to
read  the  old  RDB with SCSIConfig and to rewrite it with the "Reload RDB"
function  in  the  ConfigDevice-Window.   Never  use  the "Reload Geometry"
command  with disk drives which have been used previously on the AMIGA, and
whose  data  you  want to keep, as the logical definition of the disk drive
may not necessarily agree with the actual physical definition.

At  the  end  of  the  description of SCSIConfig you will find step-by-step
instructions  which  must  always be followed when connecting both new disk
drives and those which have already been used on the Amiga,.

*** Connecting a New Drive

In  order  to  log-on  a  drive, the drive data must be stored in the first
sectors  of  the  drive.  The Amiga uses a standardised format called Rigid
Disk Blocks (RDB).  A drive is connected by first calling up the drive data
and  then  saving  it  in  RDB.   The  next step is to divide the disk into
partitions.   These  are  logical divisions on a disk, which enable several
logical  smaller  disks to be set up on a physically larger drive.  This is
generally  only  sensible  for very large drives or for assigning a logical
disk  drive  for  a  single  task.  Partitions have the advantage that data
errors  in  one  partition,  e.g.   read/write  errors,  checksum errors or
similar  other  errors,  do  not  affect  data  in  other  partitions.  The
disadvantage  of  setting up partitions is that the division is not dynamic
(like  the  directory  sizes within a partition).  You need to have already
considered  how  much  storage  space  you  require before carrying out the
partitioning.   It  is  not  totally  impossible to subsequently change the
partition sizes but it does involve a lot of work.






Step-by-Step Instructions for Logging-on a Hard Disk

A. Connecting a New Drive

1.      Start up SCSIConfig
2.      Select the new drive
3.      Select "Config Drive"
4.      Select "Reload Geometry"
5.      Conclude with "OK"
6.      Proceed to the partition window and set up the partitions required
7.      Select "Save Changes"
8.      Exit SCSIConfig with "Quit"


A  system  reset will then be executed.  The partitions created are not yet
usable,  however,  and  must be formatted from Workbench or CLI from AMIGA-
DOS.   You  can  use  the  menu  item  "Format  Disk"  from  the  Workbench
"Pictogram"  menu,  with the option "FastFileSystem" selected (provided the
partitions  are  to  be operated under FFS).  Whenever possible, do not use
the  options  "International  Mode"  or "DirectoryCache", as these settings
significantly  reduce  the performance of the hard disk.  You can start the
AMIGA-DOS format by activating the "Fast" button; this formatting method is
reliable and only lasts a few seconds.

Further  advice  about  AMIGA-DOS  formatting  can  be  found in your AMIGA
manual.

If  a  new drive or in particular, a removable medium cannot be partitioned
in  this  way,  then  it  may  be necessary to carry out a Low-Level-Format
before calling up "Config Drive".


B.  Connecting a Drive Which is Already RDB Formatted

If the drive is automatically recognised on Workbench:

Check the partitions available with the "CheckMask" program, and adjust the
Mask and MaxTransfer values for Zorro-III operation, if necessary.

If the drive is NOT automatically recognised on Workbench:

1.      Startup SCSIConfig
2.      Select the new drive
3.      Select "Config Drive"
4.      Select "Reload RDB"
5.      Select "Partition" and check in the partition list, whether the
		  previously available partitions are displayed.

If  the  previous  partitions  are  not  displayed then quit SCSIConfig now
WITHOUT saving the changes.  Turn the computer off and remove the AutoSync-
Enable  Jumper  (see  Chapter  6,  SCSI  Configuration) from FASTLANE Z3 or
CYBERSTORM   SCSI  Module.   Then  start  this  procedure  again.   If  the
partitions  are  still  not displayed after this then we recommend carrying
out  the  procedure  with  HDToolbox  from  Commodore  (see introduction to
SCSIConfig).

6.      Conclude with "OK"
7.      Select "Save Changes"
8.      Exit SCSIConfig with "Quit"

The system will then be reset and the partitions will be available for use.
