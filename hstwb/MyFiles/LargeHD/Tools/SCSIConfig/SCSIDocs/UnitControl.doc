                      ==============================

The  Workbench  tool  UnitControl  allows  you to carry out device specific
settings  for  each  individual  device connected to the SCSI bus.  It also
allows   you   to  control  removable  media  and  tape  streamers.   Start
UnitControl  by  double-clicking  on  the  icon.  The following main window
appears:


The  upper  part  of the window displays the units present on the SCSI bus.
You  can  select  these  for further actions by clicking on the units.  The
title  of  the  selected  unit then changes color.  If you should have more
units than will fit in the window then you can scroll through the list with
the scroll bar on the right-hand side of the display window.


--- Quit

As  long  as  none of the devices is selected, only the Quit button will be
available  from  the five buttons in the lower part of the main window.  By
clicking on this button you will exit UnitControl.

As  soon  as you select a device the other buttons become available.  These
buttons allow you to control various actions of the connected device.


--- Eject:

If  the  SCSI  device  supports software controlled ejection of the medium,
then  this  button will eject the medium.  For devices which do not support
ejection of mediums the activation of this button normally causes the drive
motor to stop.

--- Stop:

This  button  turns off the drive motor of the device selected.  Hard disks
or  removable  drives  which you only use sporadically can be turned off in
this way to avoid unnecessary wear and tear and power consumption.

--- Start:

A device deactivated with Stop or for other reasons can be reactivated by
using this button.

--- Rescan

Rescan SCSI Bus for new SCSI units.

--- Mount

Try to mount partitions from a unit.

--- Prefs

Allows to set a Resident Tag with 'Save'.  May speedup your next reboot.

--- x x x x x x x x  Unit Scan Array

The unit which is activated here is scanned during the boot phase.

--- SCSI Reset Delay

The seconds the device waits after a SCSI Reset.

--- Inquiry Error Delay

The seconds the device waits after an Inquiry Error

--- Inquiry Error Retry

The retry count for an Inquiry after an Error.

--- Error Retrys

The retry count for an SCSI Operation after an SCSI Error.

--- Selection Timeout

The count of chip ticks the chip uses to determine that a selection failed.


--- Lun Reselection

Using Reselection between single Luns of a Unit.
I know no Unit which supports this.

--- Options:

By activating this button a new window is opened, where you can set special
device  parameters  for the unit selected.  This tool can be very useful if
problems occur in transmitting data to a certain device without other units
being   affected.    The   settings  under  Special  also  allow  the  data
transmission to be adjusted to maximum speed.


You  should  have  various information about the selected device at hand so
that  you  can  set  the  options  correctly.  In general, you can find the
information  in  the  datasheets  or  the  operating  instructions  of  the
connected device.


--- Asynchron/Synchron

This  button  switches  between  synchronous and asynchronous access to the
device.   The  default setting is determined from the information contained
in  the  RDB.   In  synchronous  mode  a  certain  number of data words are
transferred  in  a block, followed by a handshake.  This mode allows higher
transmission   rates  if  the  device  supports  them.   Unfortunately  the
likelihood  of  errors in the transmission also increases, in proportion to
the  size  of  the  block  to be transmitted.  In synchronous mode up to 10
MByte  data  transmission  rate is possible.  The maximum transmission rate
for a particular device is, however, affected by both the device itself and
the length and type of the SCSI cable used.

When  you activate the synchronous mode, the SCSI Controller and the device
concerned  automatically  negotiate the maximum transmission rate.  This is
mostly  10  Mb/sec for FAST SCSI devices, and 4 or 5 Mb/sec for normal SCSI
or SCSI-II devices.

If  10 Mb/sec is automatically set this does not mean that the transmission
can  take  place  securely  at  this  rate  when  the  synchronous  mode is
activated.  If occasional transmission errors occur or the hard disk "hangs
up"  at  high  transmission  rates  after setting the synchronous operation
mode,  this  can  be an indication that the connection to the device is not
secure  enough  for  the  chosen  speed.   This  problem occurs because the
transmission  rates are extremely dependant on the cable length.  In such a
case you should set the rate lower to prevent transmission faults.

Experiments  have  shown  that the highest setting for the synchronous data
transmission   is   not   necessarily   the  fastest.   Today,  nearly  all
manufacturers  rate  the  speed  of  their  hard  disks at 10 Mb/sec, which
relates  to the SCSI bus speed.  In reality, today (Autumn 1993) hardly any
hard  disks  transfer  more than 4 Mb/secec as usable sustained output.  In
practice, with a fast drive in the gigabyte range, for example, it has been
shown  that  the  transfer  values  determined from the common test program
DiskSpeed  4.2 were faster in synchron-6MB-mode than in synchron-10MB-mode.
It  is  therefore  sensible  to try out various settings with the help of a
test program when determining the optimal setting for a certain drive.


--- Slider BYTES/HANDSHAKE

This  adjuster  allows you to set the number of bytes to be transmitted per
handshake.   The  optimal  value  for  this  setting can only be determined
through  trial  and  errors.   A  setting  which  is  too  high  can  cause
transmission  errors,  which  significantly lowers the speed or even causes
read  errors.   The  regulator  is set to 8 as a starting point, which will
provide  you  with  an  acceptable  transmission rate with an extremely low
likelihood of errors.


--- Slider SYNCHRON MB/S

Here  you  can manipulate the speed of the data transmission in synchronous
operation.   As  previously  explained,  the SCSI Controller and the device
concerned  negotiate  the  maximum  transmission  rate.  If you should have
problems  with the device connected, in the form of read errors or SCSI bus
hang-ups  despite  this,  then you can decrease this value to check whether
the  device  or  the connection (cable) are unable to correctly execute the
high transmission speed.  This problem can also occur if the device accepts
10  Mb/sec  as a permitted value because the transmission rate is extremely
dependant on the cable length.

Both the Bytes/Handshake and the Synchron Mb/sec adjusters should always be
considered as linked. To find the real best possible setting some test and
trial work is necessary. In general, the default values should provide
secure transmission at the optimum transmission rate.


--- Reselection

SCSI devices are able to hand over the bus during long continual operations
to  allow  other devices to transmit data.  At the end of the operation the
device  then  demands  the  bus once again to convey its own results.  This
process is called Reselection.  As not all devices support this process and
some  devices which do support it do not work correctly in this mode, it is
possible  to activate or deactivate this mode specifically for each device.
Reselection  has  practically  no effect in access to an individual device.
Reselection requires additional protocol so you should expect a slight loss
of performance.  Only when several devices are active simultaneously on the
bus is an increase in performance likely.

--- FWC Mode

Use this to enable/diable the write RAM cache.

--- Removable

Selects if a SCSI unit is a removable or not.

--- Quit

Quit allows you to exit the Special window, but it does not change anything
in the device configuration.


--- Set

Set allows you to save the settings made for the device.


--- Reset

This  resets  the SCSI bus.  If the SCSI bus should hang up (which you will
recognise  because  the  bus  activity  LED  on  one  or more of the drives
connected  will  be  lit  continuously)  then  you can return the bus to an
active state with this button.

Reset  affects  the  whole  bus,  not  only  the device selected.  If other
devices  are  transmitting  data  when this button is activated, it will be
lost.   This  can  vary  from  harmless  read  errors  to the loss of whole
partitions.   Use  reset only if there is no disk activity in the system or
as the very last resort if the SCSI bus has crashed .
