 Patches for Individual Computer's IDE drivers  v1.1

 What does it do?
 A simple fix to allow Compact Flash cards work with XSurf,Catweasel,Buddha cards
 and IDEFix(+Express).

 Basically, the IdentifyDrive routine thought CF cards were ATAPI devices because
 it saw bit 15 set in the device's reply. But later ATA specs allowed CF cards to
 return a value of $848A which means it supports the 'CFA Feature Set'
 (For those that don't count in binary, bit 15 is set in $848A )


 What else do I need ?
  XSurf,Catweasel,Buddha and IDEFix (non-express) patches are based on binaries
 found in the last Elaborate Bytes supdate from IC's site
 http://icomp.de/t/bin/eb_final.lha
   BuddhaIDE 103.17 (08.12.00)
   CatweaselIDE 103.17 (08.12.00)
   IDEFix   119.17 (08.12.00)
   XSurfIDE 104.2 (03.07.00)


 BuddhaFlash users should also grab the flash tool to upload the new driver
 http://icomp.de/t/bin/bflash.lha

 Catweasel and non-flash Buddha users will need to burn the driver to a new EPROM.


 IDEFix Express users:
  Make the latest IDEFix (see link above) supports IDEFix Express. Make sure
  you use the installer. DON'T simply copy the IDEFix binary to your system, without
  the newer idefix.library installed, it will think it's an unregistered version.
  (basically, the old idefix.library doesn't know about the "Express dongle")

  


 PATCHES WILL ONLY WORK AGAINST THESE FILES !
 Previously installed copies could have prefs data saved in them, and patching will fail.


 How do I use spatch ?

 1. Backup the old driver
    eg. "rename IDEFix IDEFix_old"

 2. Type spatch -o<newfile> -p<patchfile> <oldfile>
    eg.  spatch -oIDEFix -pIDEFix.pch IDEFix_old
    (note: no spaces between -o and -p)



History:
   V1.1  Reworked CF patch to skip over all 'removable' tests.
         Added fix for the 'Free Signals' bug found by Cosmos.
         Removed patch for older IDEFix-Express, since the latest IDEFix supports it.
