#
# Demonstration patch configuration file for NSDPatch
# ===================================================
#
#
# Each device patch configuration must reside on a single line.
# A patch that has been installed once cannot be changed.
# The patching process works also for devices which generate a
# new device base for each OpenDevice() call. It is not Unit
# specific. For devices generating multiple bases per OpenDevice(),
# existing opens won't be patched as they can't be located.
# Once a patch is installed any Unit opened since then will be
# patched.
#
# NOTE WELL: A device patch is not meant to replace an NSD upgrade
#            forever. It will emulate NSD device behaviour on top
#            of existing devices fairly well. It will not add any
#            major safety checks or automagically fix every problem
#            you might have with an old Exec device. It may not
#            implement every single NSD detail for various device
#            types.
#
# THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER! STANDARD DISCLAIMER!
#
# How to install the patch:
#
#   1. Copy the configuration file and NSDPatch onto your boot
#      partition.  You can choose the place arbitrarily, though DEVS:
#      and C: are recommended respectively.
#
#   2. If needed, rename the configuration file and change it as
#      needed for your setup. Check the option descriptions below.
#      BE CAREFUL WHEN CHOOSING PATCH OPTIONS!
#
#   3. Add a line like this one *immediately* after SetPatch to your
#      S:Startup-Sequence:
#
#           <location>NSDPatch QUIET PCF <configfile>
#
#      You only need to specify "PCF <configfile>" if you don't use
#      DEVS:NSDPatch.cfg
#
#   4. On every subsequent reboot, the NSDPatch will silently be
#      turned on according to the configuration. There is nothing
#      more you have to do except turning off the patch for any device
#      that gets updated to be NSD compliant.

#
# There are various options, parsed in dos.library/ReadArgs() style.
# This file describes the options available with NSDPatch >=43.16.
#

#  DEVICE       The name of the device to patch (need not be resident)
#               If your device supports NSD already, it usually is
#               *NOT* wise to patch it!
#               You can check this with NSDQuery

#  COMMANDS     A comma separated list of the supported command
#               numbers. It is not necessary to specify the general
#               NSD commands like NSCMD_DEVICEQUERY.
#               When specifying commands, you can exclude some with
#               a subsequent negative specification as shown below
#               in the various patch lines.
#               Just use the "!" character to specify a command number
#               or range to be subsequently excluded again.
#               (Needs "DEVICE" option)

#  DEVICETYPE   The numeric or symbolic NSD device type to set
#               (Needs "COMMANDS" option)

#  SKIPMOUNT/S  After a trackdisk like device is patched, NSDPatch
#               automagically checks if any 64 bit partitions are mounted
#               but not yet activated. These partitions will then be
#               activated to support, e.g., the V43 FastFileSystem
#               which will activate only for big partitions
#               if the underlying device supports the NSD 64 bit
#               command set.
#               To suppress this feature, specify this option.
#               Normally, you should not use this option.
#               (Needs "DEVICETYPE" option)

#  IOERRNOCMD/S If the device to patch does not support IOERR_NOCMD
#               correctly, i.e., if it crashes on unknown commands,
#               specify this option. Only the commands specified
#               via the "COMMANDS" option will be accepted then.
#               All other requests will be safely returned with the
#               IOERR_NOCMD error.
#               (Needs "DEVICETYPE" option)

#  TD64/S       If the device to be patched supports the TD64 command
#               set, use this option. The NSD trackdisk extensions will
#               automatically be redirected then to make use of that
#               functionality for e.g. the V43 FastFileSystem.
#               Otherwise a simple HD_SCSICMD fallback is implemented
#               for trackdisk like devices. This fallback is _very_
#               simple to emulate 64 bit commands. Don't expect magic.
#               (Needs "DEVICETYPE" option)

#  ACTIVATE     A DOS pattern to tell which DOS device names should
#               be activated to e.g. start up a filesystem on a
#               patched device. It is safe to specify already
#               active devices. Devices where the name is "hidden"
#               by a volume of the same name currently won't be
#               activated. You may want to specify the partition
#               names of partitions exceeding the 4GB barrier here
#               for a patched device with the V43 FastFileSystem
#               if you have used the SKIPMOUNT option when patching
#               the device. Don't specify a trailing ':' in the
#               pattern.

#  RDBUNIT/N    If you have a trackdisk like boot device that
#               crashes on unknown commands instead of returning
#               IOERR_NOCMD, you will need this option,
#               "IOERRNOCMD", and "ACTIVATE". You can't boot from a
#               partition exceeding the 4GB barrier with an old
#               style device and the V43 FastFileSystem, and you
#               must not mark any partitions exceeding that barrier
#               as automountable if you have a device that does not
#               support IOERR_NOCMD. These partitions won't be
#               activated automatically by e.g. V43 FFS until the
#               patch is installed. To activate or mount these
#               partitions automatically after the patch is in
#               place, specify the device unit number to scan here
#               and the partition names with the "ACTIVATE" option.
#               The Rigid Disk Block (RDB) on the named unit will be
#               scanned and all named partitions will be mounted.
#               If you specify partitions that are already
#               mounted, an error will be returned. Actually, this
#               option is useful as a general "late mount"
#               functionality!

#  MOUNTANY/S   This option is obsolete. Late mounting will always
#               look at all RDB entries on "RDBUNIT" matching the
#               "ACTIVATE" pattern, starting with NSDPatch 43.18.

#  VERSION/N    If you know the exact version of a certain device to
#  REVISION/N   be patched, specify these options. The patch line
#               will only be used if this version and revision
#               can be found. As NSDPatch will not skip configuration
#               lines for already patched devices, you can make a list
#               of certain patches for specific versions, followed by
#               a "generic" line for all other versions.
#               This is shown below for scsi.device.
#               Note the usefulness for these options with the ISNSD
#               and VERSIONISNSD options!
#
#               Patches with version and revision info always take
#               precedence over a general patch line for the same
#               deviceif they apply.

#  SANA2MAGIC/S Some SANA2 devices don't take it very well if they
#               get passed a NULL buffer management pointer on OpenDevice()
#               This not only makes it hard for NSD to operate nicely, it
#               also confuses some of the popular SANA2 debugging tools.
#               If you have a device like this, you may want to try this
#               option. It should help by providing a dummy pointer if needed.

#  ISNSD/S      Will recognize and not patch any device with at least
#               the given VERSION and, optionally,  REVISION.

#  VERSIONISNSD/S   Works like ISNSD for the exact VERSION.REVISION.
#               This is useful in case somebody put out a non NSD
#               device suddenly with a higher version number. Tss.
#               What an idea.

#  SINGLEPATCHONLY/S
#               NSDPatch will patch a device just once on the "first" call
#               to OpenDevice(). This option is still accepted, but OBSOLETE,
#               as this behaviour is NSDPatch default starting with NSDPatch
#               version 43.12.
#

#  TRYMULTIPATCH/S
#               Normally, NSDPatch will check a device to patch on
#               the initial OpenDevice() call and patch it
#               appropriately. This behaviour is default starting
#               with NSDPatch 43.12. If you encounter a device that
#               changes its own device function addresses while it
#               is open, you should use this option. This is highly
#               unlikely, though, as this behaviour would be rather
#               inefficient and possibly crash prone. Note
#               that when using this option, you may encounter
#               infinite loops if other tools like debuggers
#               also patch into the device vectors. Before 43.12,
#               this option was the default setting but due to its
#               dangerous nature, SINGLEPATCHONLY is now the
#               default setting.

#  INTBEGINIO/S
#               Some devices may be used from within interrupts
#               to a certain extent. timer.device and audio.device
#               have functionality that may be used from interrupts.
#               Specify this option only if a device may be safely
#               called from within supervisor code. In supervisor
#               mode, NSDPatch functionality is then bypassed to
#               preserve system stability. Do not specify this option
#               if it is not needed as it will add some amount of
#               processing overhead.
#

#
#  MAPTODEVICE/K
#  MAPTOUNIT/K/N
#               By using this type, you can define mappings from one
#               device/unit combination to another. This is
#               useful if special tools check on the device
#               name for certain functionality and you really want
#               to use another device/unit. Examples can be found
#               below. It is usually unwise to map devices to
#               devices of a different type because the command
#               sets may well differ in a way that confuse non NSD
#               aware applications. Note that mapping trackdisk
#               units to other devices may be dangerous unless you
#               run any "noclick" hack before NSDPatch!
#

#
#  FIXSCSIUPDATE/S
#               The V40 scsi.device has a problem with the JAZ-drive
#               A CMD_UPDATE will start up the drive even if there is
#               nothing to update. For any trackdisk like device
#               with HD_SCSICMD, you # can specify this option to
#               fix a JAZ-drive. CMD_UPDATE will be replaced then
#               with a safe version, which only syncs up the
#               drive's caches if the drive is ready.
#

#
#  AVOIDFORBID/S
#               The AmigaOS kernel Exec single threads any device
#               opener with Forbid(), meaning that only the task
#               opening the device will run at that time. Some
#               devices rely on this, some modern devices don't.
#               Forbid() is bad, because opening device can take
#               some time, which means that other tasks are blocked
#               in a significant and possibly deadly way for time
#               critical applications. A better method to do single
#               threading is use of a semaphore, which
#               unfortunatley can't be generally used due to
#               compatibility reasons. If you know that a device
#               can handle a semaphore, specify this option. The
#               Forbid() will then be automagically converted into
#               a semaphore call when the device is opened.
#               Special magic is integrated for console.device, which
#               tends to Forbid() for a long, long time.
#               ONLY TOUCH THIS IF YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING!

# Default configuration lines for the V40 (OS 3.1) devices.
# If you find any bugs or omissions, please report them.
# With some work, all the correct versions could be added,
# and this file could contain complete patch information for
# different OS versions. Feedback on this is welcome.

#
# Add a comment '#' character to those lines where you already
# use a NSD device.
#

# Notes:
#
#   - audio.device is marked with IOERRNOCMD. It does not crash on
#     unknown commands, but it doesn't set IOERR_NOCMD correctly.
#
#   - As a convenience measure for A4000T users, a line with
#     2nd.scsi.device, equal to the scsi.device line, has been added.
#
#   - mfm.device V38/V40 trashes a CPU register on OpenDevice() and
#     has a special private configuration command. The patch fixes
#     the former automagically (as for any device), and the patch
#     line reflects the latter.
#
#   - scsi.device V40 and before V43.22 will not handle CMD_UPDATE well,
#     This is worked around by the FIXSCSIUPDATE option in the respective
#     lines.
