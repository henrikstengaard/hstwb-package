                       Professional File System III V5.3
                       ================================

Notes for public domain release
===============================
This is the Professional File System III as it was released back in 1999,
with the patches from PFS3_5153 applied.

Note that the sources, also released on Aminet, will not result in
exactly the same binaries, because some minor changes have been made to the
source code.

Installation
============

> Install PFS3 using the icon. DO NOT copy files directly from the
  CD onto you harddrive.


Changes since PFS 3 V5.1 (revision 18.3)
========================================


> Shared read-write

  MODE_FINDOUTPUT is now a fully shared lock. In previous releases it was
  single writer multiple reader, now it is multiple writer multiple reader.
  Some programs like Apache had problems with this.

> Fixed bug: Deldir date

  When using list the dates in the deldir were incorrect

> Fixed bug: Possible crash when listing deldir

  If the deldir contains some very large files, PFS3 could crash while listing
  the deldir.

Changes since PFSDoctor V1.3
============================

> new feature: Undo Format

  Use 'undo format' to get a partition back that has accidentally been quick
  formatted.

> new feature: Search Filesystem

  Use 'search filesystem' if your RDB is lost and you don't remember where the
  partitions are. Search Filesystem searches the specified device for PFS3
  partitions. If it finds one you are offered the option to save a mountfile.
  The mountfile contains all the information needed to rebuild the RDB for that
  partition or can be used for manual mounting. PFSdocter continues by checking
  the partition and searching for the next one.

> repairing NON DOS disks

  PFSDoctor now can also repair non-dos disks

> improved performance

> bugfix: pfsdoctor sometimes left the partition in an invalid state after repair
  and had to be run two times. 


Changes since PFSII V4.2
========================

> Larger delete directory

  The deldir can now be configured to hold upto 992 deleted files. The
  default size is 63. This can be changed with the supplied SetDeldir
  utility.

> HDInsttools

  HDInsttools, written by Olivier Kastl, is now included in the PFS3
  package. 

> PFSDoctor

  PFSDoctor is a brandnew disk repair program, included on the CD.

> Long filenames

  PFS3 now supports filenames of upto 108 characters

> Device name in requesters

  PFS now shows the devicename in all requesters. This makes it easier
  to see which disk a requester comes from.

> Italian version

  An italian version is included


Changes since PFSII V4.1
========================

> Read only mode can be disabled with the lock command

  If the disk is put in read only mode due to errors, it can now be put back
  in normal read/write mode with the lock command from the c: directory.
  We recommend to use this only in order to reformat the disk.


> Support for TD64

  PFS2 now supports TD64 devices. This allows the use of harddisks larger than
  4G without using direct scsi. To use TD64 install the standard version on
  a partition exceeding the 4G border and TD64 will be used automatically.
  A direct scsi version is still included to support large disks for devices
  which are not TD64 compatible.


> Support for large partitions

  PFS2 now supports partitions of upto 104G (was 5G).


Fixed bugs
----------

5.1

> 'Beta Warning 1 bug'. This error could occur when a large number
  of files was changed at once, e.g. setting the archive bit on all
  files of the disk.

> Reserved area full problems. PFS3 volumes can hold more files.

> Problems with 1024 byte blocksizes fixed

> Hardlink problems fixed. Hardlinks to rollover files failed.
  Renaming and overwriting hardlinks across directories failed.

> Enforcer hit during format fixed

4.2

> Errors when formatting partitions larger than 5G
  PFS2 didn't check for maximum partition size. Version 4.2 support upto 104G.

> 'Read outside partition' errors on Phase 5 boards.
  fixed.

> Crashed if rolloverfile of size 0 was created
  fixed

> The MaxTransfer and the maximum blocksize where stated wrong in the german
  manual.

> The French version showed a wrong version number in the format requester.

> The dosdrivers were not on the distribution CD.
