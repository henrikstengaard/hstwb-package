Introduction:
I was quite excited to finally see an updated version of the SCSI/IDE drivers
on the Amiga International, Inc. website.  Finally, an IDE driver capable of
utilizing IDE/ATAPI cd-rom drives!  And it was FREE!  Unfortunately, the
upgraded drivers also caused some problems with my system.  But,
unfortunately, it was not without it's problems.  First and most importantly,
it threw my clock WAY out of whack (which I had a real problem tracking down,
with a slew of add-ons and hacks in my wbstartup drawer and startup-sequence).
Secondly, on April 4th, it decided to throw a recoverable alert at me
notifying me that it was a beta version and that it had expired.  Fine, but
the alert also crashed my system at that point and it took several resets to
bring my machine to it's senses.  So, that night I set about writing this
patch.  It worked by jumping to the exit routine no matter what the date is,
thereby bypassing the alert code completely.

Requirements:
OS3.x (V40.xx)
hard disk
SCSI_IDE43_23.lha (available from www.amiga.de)

Usage:
patchstrip <Axxx.LD.STRIP> <newfilename>

where <Axxx.LD.STRIP> is the AmigaDOS path/filename of the module to patch.
You must be using the V43.23 modules, as I have no idea what this will do
to other versions of the modules. The Amiga International, Inc. archive uses
A300.LD.STRIP,A600...,A1000...,A4000T... and SCSIDISK.LD.STRIP as the
filenames that they de-archive to.  If you have renamed them like I have, be
sure to give the proper path and filename here.  As far as I can tell, this
patch should work fine on any of these modules, although this patch has only
been tested so far on my machine only.

<newfilename> is the destination path/filename for the patched version of the
module.  This patch does not overwrite the original module, so this leaves
you with a backup if the patch for some reason fails.

This program has been tested on my equipment and works fine.  My configuration
is an A4000/040T with 18 MB RAM, 2.1GB Quantum Fireball SCSI HD, NEC 24 speed
ATAPI CD-ROM.

I would also like to thank David Benn for his excellant ACE compiler, with
which this program was made in a whopping fifteen minutes.
