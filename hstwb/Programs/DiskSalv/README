[1mDiskSalv 4 (V13.6) Release Notes[0m

	This is the second commercial release of the DiskSalv 4
program. The DiskSalv program and distribution materials are Copyright
1991-1996 by Dave Haynie, All Rights Reserved.  This program is a commercial
release, and may not be copied in any form, except as part of ordinary
single-user backup activities.

[1mAbout AmigaGuide[0m

	Commodore's AmigaGuide is not included with this distribution.
If you have a 3.x system, you'll want to change the iam.guide and
DiskSalv.guide icons to use MultiView rather than the AmigaGuide program.
Otherwise, make sure that you've installed Commodore's freely
redistributable AmigaGuide package, available from numerous sources.

	Bugs with AmigaGuide cause problems on some systems with
DiskSalv's Guide files.  We have not been able to determine the cause of
these problems. In the worst case, you can always read the documentation
with a viewer such as "more."  There are also third-party
freely-redistributable AmigaGuide viewers such as MoreText.  If you have
problems with DiskSalv3 because of AmigaGuide, simply select the option
not to use it when DiskSalv3 brings up a requester telling you that you
have an early version of AmigaGuide.  Upgrading to AmigaOS 3.1 is a good
thing generally, and no AmigaGuide problems have been reported with 3.x
systems and DiskSalv3.

	(12.17 update)The on-line documentation has been updated. This
contains a list of the enhancements, and it works around some of the
bugs in V34 versions of the AmigaGuide.library.

[1mA Note On Packaging[0m

	Please reuse and recycle.  While we've done our best to
minimize DiskSalv's packaging, we know that even this is not enough.
For direct orders, we ship just a disk in a mailer, and there's not
much you can do with that.  If you bought DiskSalv 3 off the store shelf,
please pass the outer wrap on to a friend to tell them about DiskSalv,
and please use the mailer the next time you need to send a disk.

[1mUpdates[0m

	Updates to DiskSalv 4 will probably be available as freely
redistributable patches from all the usual sources.  If you don't
have a modem or user's group through which to obtain freely
redistributable software, you are missing out on a lot!  (Shameless
plug:  "Connect Your Amiga! A Guide to the Internet, LANs, BBSs and
Online Services" has good information about sources of freely
redistributable software.)

The most current updates should always be available via anonymous ftp in the
directory:

	file:ftp.iam.com/biz/iam/disksalv

[1mUser Support[0m

	Unlimited user support is available, via Internet and FAX. Please
note that this is provided to answer real questions, problems, etc. It is
[1mnot[0m an interactive on-line manual.  Such a manual is provided in the
DiskSalv.guide file. No free telephone support is provided for DiskSalv4.
Contacts:

		Internet:	disksalv-bugs@iam.com
		FAX:		+1-609-224-0442  DISKSALV SUPPORT ONLY

	[1mDo not[0m send orders to Dave's fax or email (above). For orders,
contact IAM or it's distributors as listed in the AmigaGuide file for
contact information.  [1mDo not[0m call IAM for support or bug reports for
DiskSalv 3.

	We request, if you wish return correspondence by FAX of any kind,
please furnish a real FAX number that's active at all times. We will not
retry FAX numbers that only answer part-time.

	Note that Dave Haynie attempts to answer direct email, but will
give preferential treatment to email sent to the official support address.

	Serious questions will be answered as soon as possible. Bug reports
will be immediately researched, but no return acknowledgement will be sent
unless requested. Bugs not to report:

    1) Old DiskSalv 2 problems. These can be, and probably have been,
       addressed via the DiskSalv 2 shareware support mechanisms; send
       mail/email directly to Dave Haynie, and he'll act/reply as he
       see fit.

    2) Don't complain about funny DiskSalv requesters if you're using
       any of the "Requester Improvement" hacks from the public domain.
       All of these examined so far do not fully support the capabilities
       Intuition BuildSysRequest() function, and therefore may mutate
       DiskSalv's requesters for the worse.  If you don't like this,
       don't run such programs -- DiskSalv is fully compliant Intuition
       rules.

    3) Don't complain about DiskSalv not recovering/salvaging your MS-DOS,
       OS/2, Windows NT, Macintosh, ISO9660, or other non-AmigaDOS-standard
       disk format. It doesn't do this.  However, as of DiskSalv 3, it does
       attempt to identify some of these alien formats, and when it does
       successfully do so, it attempts to prevent you from doing something
       stupid to that disk.

    4) Don't complain about abuse of the Device Editor window. DiskSalv
       tries to be smart about things, but it's not Kreskin -- it doesn't
       attempt to figure out that you're doing something wrong. If you are,
       sorry, but like most power tools, you can get hurt if you don't know
       what you're doing.  DiskSalv 3's user interface takes extra measures
       to simplify the standard stuff and keep the more advanced features
       out of the way.  You aren't going to accidently stumble across this
       stuff.

[1mFileSystem Support[0m

	We are interested in supporting any file system in common use on the
Amiga. To date, this has been limited to the AmigaDOS native file system
variations. However, we're more than happy to support any 3rd party custom
file systems in future DiskSalv versions.

	If you have developed or are developing a file system, and would like
us to consider support for it in DiskSalv, you can contact us via mail or
email, or send the following:

	- One copy of the file system handler, and anything else necessary to
	  install the file system on a standard 32-bit Amiga.

	- Details of the file system's structure, including directories,
	  files, links, etc.

	- Any other details on the file system: file system type identification
	  code, support/non-support of different block sizes, etc.

Obviously, if we receive 20 new file systems, there isn't likely to be time
to implement them all in the next release. However, any file systems received
will be prioritized into the enhancement list. We do expect to support any
file system in common use, especially if it's clearly documented.

LEGAL
	The standard software disclaimer: This software isn't yours, it's
	still ours, we're just letting you use it. Of course, we don't
	guarantee that you actually can use it, that it'll do anything we
	claim it will, or even that it won't cause irreversible physical harm
	to your computer, its hard drive, you, your cat, your close
	relatives, or even most of a city block.  Do not taunt HappyFunBall...

	In other words, Dave Haynie, Dale L. Larson, IAM and their suppliers
	do not warrant the performance or results you may obtain by using
	DiskSalv. We make no warranties, express or implied, as to
	performance, noninfringement of third party rights, merchantability,
	fitness for any particular purpose, or anything else that we can
	possibly disclaim.

	In case you still don't get the idea, let us paraphrase the
	disclaimer from from Haventree Software's EasyFlow program.
	(Haventree can sue us if they don't like us reproducing their great
	prose.)

	If DiskSalv doesn't work: tough.  If you lose millions because
	DiskSalv messes up, it's you that's out the millions, not us.  If you
	don't like this disclaimer: tough. We reserve the right to do the
	absolute minimum provided by law, up to and including nothing.  This
	is basically the same disclaimer that comes with all software
	packages, but ours is in plain English and theirs is in legalese. We
	didn't want to include any disclaimer at all, but our lawyers
	insisted.
