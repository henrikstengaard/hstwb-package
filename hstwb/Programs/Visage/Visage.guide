@{u}@{b}Introduction@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

<Sigh> Yet another picture viewer. :)@{par}

Oh well, what can I say? There was no picture viewer available that suited
all my needs. They were lacking such trivial things as looking for external
break signals, and more important things such as good monitor support.@{par}

But Visage is different. It has many features; some are not available in
any other picture viewer for the Amiga (as far as I know). Since some of
these features rely on things introduced in OS 3.0, this program requires
OS 3.0. There are several viewers that work on OS 2.04, so it is not a
major problem, IMHO.@{par}

The goal was a rather fast viewer, with many features. Picture quality was
not the most important thing (this mainly applies to the HAM and color
rendering).@{par}

@endnode




@node REQUIREMENTS "Visage.guide/Requirements"
@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}Requirements@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

Visage should work on any Amiga that has OS 3.0 or higher. 512 KB of memory
should be enough for operation, but more memory is indeed recommended
(especially if you want to view large pictures). There are no required disk
based libraries, although Visage will be limited if some are not
available.@{par}

I decided to let Visage require OS 3.0, since I otherwise would need to
rewrite several new functions in OS 3.0, or write code to work around bugs.
One feature cannot be implemented at all using OS 2.0. Despite all this, I
might make Visage support OS 2.0 in the future (if @{" I " link AUTHOR} get
requests for it. As I have not got any yet... ;).@{par}

Included is also a version compiled for a 68020 CPU or higher and a FPU (as
of version 39.15, version 39.18 introduces the FPU requirement). If a 68020
or better and a FPU is not available, this version will silently exit.@{par}

Please note that the 68020 version is optimized for a 68040 CPU, but works
fine with a 68020 and better.@{par}

@node LIBRARIES "Visage.guide/Requirements/Required libraries"
@toc REQUIREMENTS
@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}Required libraries@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

The following disk based libraries are not necessary for Visage to operate,
but certain things will not work if they are not available:@{_ipar}

@{b}asl.library@{ub} version 38 or higher@{line}
For the file, screen mode and monitor (!) requesters. If not available, you
will get a warning if you try to use these requesters.@{par}

@{b}cybergraphics.library@{ub} version 40 or higher@{line}
For rendering to screens deeper than eight bits.@{par}

@{b}datatypes.library@{ub} version 39 or higher@{line}
For the datatypes reader. To work properly, suitable datatypes are needed
as well. Some datatypes are included with the system; several exist as
different kinds of freely distributable software.@{par}

@{b}diskfont.library@{ub} version 39 or higher@{line}
To load disk-based fonts, if requested by the
@{" FONT " link FONT} argument. If not available you are limited to ROM
fonts.@{par}

@{b}iffparse.library@{ub} version 39 or higher@{line}
For the IFF ILBM reader.@{par}

@{b}mathieeedoubbas.library@{ub} version 37 or higher, and@{line}
@{b}mathieeedoubtrans.library@{ub} version 37 or higher@{line}
For the PNG reader (the gamma correction).@{par}

@{b}reqtools.library@{ub} version 38 or higher@{line}
For the password requester that appears if an Xpk-encrypted picture is
encountered, but no password was specified. ReqTools can be found on Aminet
and BBS:es.@{par}

@{b}xpkmaster.library@{ub}@{line}
To view Xpk compressed or encrypted IFF ILBM pictures. For it to work
properly, suitable sublibraries are needed as well. Xpk can be found on
Aminet and BBS:es. For best operation, XPK version 3 or higher is
reccommended (but any version should be enough for operation).@{par}

@endnode




@node INSTALLATION "Visage.guide/Installation"
@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}Installation@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

To install Visage it is recommended to use the included Installer script.
If you want to start the Installer from a Shell, please use the included
ShellInstall script, which sets the Installer arguments correctly.@{par}

If you still want to install it by hand, here is some information on how to
do that. Some knowledge about the Amiga is assumed:@{_ipar}

Copy the program (Visage) and perhaps the manual (Visage.guide) to some
drawer. That is all you really need in order to use Visage.@{par}

If you want Visage to be localized, you need to install a catalog as well.
The catalogs can be found in the drawer `Visage/Catalogs'. The drawers
found there contian the catalog for the language in question. Simply copy
the catalog to the corresponding drawer in `Locale:Catalogs' or
`ProgDir:Catalogs' (where `ProgDir:' is the drawer where you installed
Visage).@{par}

To install the 68020 version of Visage, you need to create it first. That
can be done with a shell, like this (assuming the current drawer is
`Visage' in the release archive):@{_IPar2}

C/SPatch -oVisage_020 -pVisage_020.pch Visage@{_OPar2}

The file `Visage_020' now contains the 68020-optimized version of
Visage.@{par}

Then you can copy the tools you need (from the drawer `Visage/C') to
somewhere convenient, preferably a drawer in the command search path (such
as `C:').@{_opar}

The included Installer script does all this for you, as well as updating
the tooltypes in the icon, if necessary.@{par}

@node ARGUMENTS "Visage.guide/Arguments"
@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}Arguments@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

Visage can be started from a Shell or the Workbench. For Shell users it
should be noted that Visage is pure, and may be made resident.@{par}

In the case of Workbench start, the tooltypes may be specified in either
the program icon, the picture icon(s), or any other icon (preferably
without an associated file). All tooltypes are collected (tooltypes found
later on overrides earlier ones) and parsed before viewing the
pictures.@{par}

@{" VisageOpts " link VISAGEOPTS} can be used to specify new
defaults.@{par}@{_Tabs}

@node VISAGEOPTS "Visage.guide/Arguments/VisageOpts"
@toc ARGUMENTS
@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}VisageOpts@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

New default values may be specified by entering them in the
@{i}VisageOpts@{ui} configuration file or environment variable. The search
order is as follows:@{_ipar}

If the environment variable @{i}ConfigPath @{ui}¹ exist, then try to read
the file @{i}VisageOpts @{ui}in the drawer specified by
@{i}ConfigPath.@{ui}@{par}

If the environment variable or the file in the @{i}ConfigPath @{ui}drawer
does not exist, then read the environment variable @{i}VisageOpts, @{ui}if
present.@{_opar}

Put all arguments on any number of lines, similar to if Visage was started
from the Shell. Comments start with a `#' or `;' at the start of the line,
and they end at the end of that same line.@{par}

To disable the reading of @{i}VisageOpts @{ui}(e.g. in a script), use the
@{b}NOENV@{ub} switch. This disables both the environment variable and the
@{i}ConfigPath @{ui}file.@{par}

If a switch is specified in @{i}VisageOpts, @{ui}then by specifying it
again on the command line you will turn off that switch. Thus, if
@{b}CENTER@{ub} is found in @{i}VisageOpts, @{ui}and @{b}CENTER@{ub} is
specified on the command line (or in the tooltypes), no centering will
occur.@{par}

Text or numeric arguments specified on the command line will simply
override any arguments specified in @{i}VisageOpts. @{ui}Most text
arguments interprets the empty string ("") as if the string was not
specified (i.e., it reverts to the default value).@{par}

Two arguments in @{i}VisageOpts @{ui}will always be ignored:
@{b}FILES@{ub} and @{b}NOENV@{ub}. You will not get a warning or anything
if they are specified; they are silently ignored. This has the side effect
that unknown options are ignored (they are "swallowed" by the
@{b}FILES@{ub} argument).@{par}

¹ If you specify `Progdir:' here (to get the same drawer as where the
program resides), please remember that you should not make the program
resident in that case. If you do, you will get `Please insert volume
Progdir:' requesters, which can be annoying.@{par}

The name of the @{i}ConfigPath @{ui}variable was deliberately chosen to be
general. The hope is that other programs also will use this, at least as a
part of their configuration file search path.@{par}

@node FILES "Visage.guide/Arguments/FILES"
@toc ARGUMENTS
@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}Files@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

Here you specify the files you wish to view. You may enter any number of
files and drawers here, using patterns if you like.@{par}

If you enter the name of a drawer, or no files at all, then a file
requester will open, located in that drawer (unless @{b}ALL@{ub} has been
specified). If you in this requester specify the name of a file that does
not exist, then Visage will treat is as a pattern. However, if the
@{b}NOFILECHECK@{ub} option have been specified, Visage till always tread
the specified name as a pattern.@{par}

If no file is selected or specified in the requester (and the requester is
not cancelled), then Visage will display all pictures in the drawer in
question (and any pattern will be used).@{par}

You may even use this argument as a tooltype in an icon. So, if you would
like to get a slideshow over some pictures in a drawer, you can use the
following tooltypes (in an icon without its corresponding file). The
default tool should be set to Visage:@{_ipar}

FILES=Pics:Nature@{line}
ALL@{line}
DELAY=60@{_opar}

or something similar. A double click on that icon will start the
slideshow.@{par}

@{u}Note@{uu}:@{_ipar}
Do not use this argument in the Visage icon to specify a default drawer,
that the file requester should open in, if e.g. no other arguments were
specified. The result will not be what you expect. Rather, use the
@{b}DRAWER@{ub} argument, which exists for this purpose.@{par}

You can also use the @{b}LIST@{ub} argument to display a list of pictures,
specified wirh a text file.@{_opar}

Here you can specify if Visage should (try to) blank the borders of the

@{b}ON@{ub}@{line}
Turn on border blanking.@{par}

@{b}OFF@{ub}@{line}
Turn off border blanking.@{par}

@{b}DEFAULT@{ub}@{line}
Use the system default.@{_opar}

If an invalid blanking mode is specified, you will be told about it, and
the default (@{b}DEFAULT@{ub}) will be used.@{par}

@{u}Notes@{uu}:@{_ipar}
This affects the systems border blanking flag only. Thus, it will probably
not work on graphics cards (I do not know if any graphics card support this
flag).@{par}

Setting the argument to @{b}OFF@{ub} does not seem to work if the system
global border blanking flag is activated. At least this is the case on my
system.@{par}

The vertical centering does not look that good if border blanking is
on.@{_opar}

Here you can specify the render mode for "deep" (more than your system
normally can handle) and true color pictures. The following modes are
available:@{_ipar}

@{b}DEFAULT@{ub}, @{b}BEST@{ub}@{line}
Use the "best" available mode. If high color (15 or 16 bit) modes are
available, use them; if true color (24 bit) modes are available, use
them. Even if true color modes are available, a high color mode may be
selected, if it is considered to be more suitable.@{par}

@{b}GRAY@{ub}, @{b}GREY@{ub}@{line}
Pictures will be rendered in grayscale. Dithering is used by default, if
the screen is less than eight bits deep. @{par}

Pictures will be rendered in a HAM mode (HAM8 if available, HAM6
otherwise). Currently no dithering is done.@{par}

@{b}8@{ub}, @{b}NORMAL@{ub}@{line}
Pictures will be reduced to the largest number of colors in a "normal"
palette screen that is available on your system. 256 colors (eight bits)
should be available, or the result will not be very good. Dithering can be
used to improve quality.@{par}

@{b}15@{ub}, @{b}16@{ub}, @{b}HIGH@{ub}@{line}
Pictures will be rendered to screens that are up to 15 bits deep, if such
screens are available via CyberGraphX (or compatible). Or rather: screen
modes with at least 15 bits will be used to render true color pictures.
Specify @{b}16@{ub} to request a screen mode with at least 16 bits.@{par}

@{b}24@{ub}, @{b}TRUE@{ub}@{line}
Pictures will be rendered to screens that are up to 24 bits deep, if such
screens are available via CyberGraphX (or compatible).@{_opar}

@{u}Notes@{uu}:@{_ipar}
The @{b}NORMAL@{ub} color rendering is a so called one pass render with a
fixed palette. This means that it is rather fast, but the quality is not
the best. By default, the rendering includes ordered dither, but this may
be changed, to improve either the speed or the quality (the quality will
drop significantly if dithering is disabled).@{par}

The datatypes reader is also affected by this argument. If high- or
truecolor rendering is requested, then Visage will ask the datatype to
return data in the so called version 43 format, which is better suited for
display on a graphics card screen, and includes up to 24 bit deep screens
(normally, the datatypes are limited to eight bits).@{_opar}

@node COMMAND "Visage.guide/Arguments/COMMAND"
@toc ARGUMENTS
@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}COMMAND@{ub}@{uu}  Synonym: @{b}CMD@{ub}@{_opar}

Here you can specify a command that can be executed for each viewed
picture. To execute the command, press the `e'-key when the picture in
question is displayed. When in @{b}TEST@{ub} mode, the command will be
executed when a picture with an error is found.@{par}

As of Visage 39.22, the way to specify where the file name will be placed
in the command string have changed. Before, the first occurance of the
string '[]' was replaced with the name in question. The following
parameters can be used any number of times as of Visage 39.22:@{_ipar}

@{b}[]@{ub}	Same as %n (for backwards compatibility).@{line}
@{b}%f@{ub}	The full path to the picture.@{line}
@{b}%n@{ub}	The name of the picture.@{line}
@{b}%p@{ub}	The drawer the picture is in. This will always be terminated by a
':' or a '/'@{line}
@{b}%%@{ub}	A single '%' char.@{_opar}

If none of the above are specified, the name of the picture will be added
to the end of the command.  To avoid this - or rather, the effect of it -
put a semicolon (';') at the end of your command. As normal shell parsing
will be done, the file name will be treated as a comment, and will not be
passed to the command.@{par}

The command will be executed with the current drawer set to the same drawer
as the picture. The name will always be quoted (e.g. to make it easy to
parse from Rexx). The command is run asynchronously, so you may continue to
the next picture when you like. If the command could not be run for some
reason, the screen will flash (if no command is specified, this will not
happen).@{par}


This argument makes it easy to mark pictures for deletion or something
similar. In that case, a command like:@{_ipar}

Filenote [] "Delete this picture"@{_opar}

or:@{_ipar}

Filenote %n "Delete this picture"@{_opar}

can be useful. Then simply press `e' for the pictures you do not want to
keep, and do the actual deletings from a shell or a directory utility.
Using the above command rather than `Delete' has the benefit that it is
easy to undo, in case you press the key by mistake.@{par}

The command `Move [] TO Pics:' can cause problem in case several pictures
with the same name (but in different drawers) are processed. An ARexx
script can be used to work around this problem, if needed. Note that a
`Move' command is not included with the OS.@{par}

@{u}Note@{uu}:@{_ipar}
To specify the above example from a shell, you must enter it like
this:@{_ipar2}

COMMAND="FileNote [] *"Delete this picture*""@{_opar2}

just enter it as the first example shows.@{_opar}

Here you can specify which kind of dithering that should be used, when
rendering pictures to certain @{b}COLOR@{ub} modes. For grayscale render,
dither is only used when the screen displays less than 256 colors.@{par}

Currently, the following dither types are available:@{_ipar}

@{b}NONE@{ub}@{line}
No dithering. This is the fastest, but also gives the lowest quality. It is
not recommended if @{b}COLOR@{ub} rendering is used.@{par}

@{b}ORDERED@{ub}, @{b}ORD@{ub}@{line}
Ordered dithering. A fast dither, but the quality is not the best. Quite
sufficient for grayscale images though. This is the default.@{par}

@{b}FS@{ub}@{line}
Floyd-Steinberg dithering. Gives very good quality, but is slower than
@{b}ORDERED@{ub} (about 30% in the @{b}COLOR@{ub} render case).@{_opar}

@{u}Notes@{uu}:@{_ipar}
The font size currently needs to be between 4 and 64 (inclusive). If it is
out of range, the specified font will be ignored, and the default is

Visage will try to load the font from disk during program startup. If this

been displayed, any specified @{b}LIST@{ub} file is opened.

Visage will then read the file, one line at a time, and processes each line
as a file name, as if it was entered in the @{b}FILES@{ub} argument.@{par}

@node MODE "Visage.guide/Arguments/MODE"
@toc ARGUMENTS
@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}MODE@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

Here you can specify which screen mode the pictures should be displayed
with. There are several ways to specify the mode:@{_ipar}

Via a screen mode requester. Simply enter @{b}REQUEST@{ub} or
@{b}?@{ub} after the @{b}MODE@{ub} keyword. This requires asl.library to
be available.@{par}

A decimal or hexadecimal number, "describing" the mode. If the number
starts with `$' or `0x' it is assumed to be in hexadecimal. The included
program GetModeID can be used to find the (decimal) number for a certain
mode.@{par}

A text string (anything that is not covered by the above). Either a name
from the display database, or an algorithmic name.@{_opar}

Specifying a (valid) mode here will override the @{b}MONITOR@{ub} and
@{b}WBMONITOR@{ub} arguments.@{par}

If the specified mode is not capable of displaying the picture for some
reason, Visage will try to find a replacement mode that is as similar as
possible. Thus, you usually do not need to worry about things such as HAM
and EHB. Visage should handle that automatically.@{par}

@{u}Note@{uu}:@{_ipar}
Visage also understands the "normal" mode names (as shown by the ScreenMode
preferences program). However, the normal mode name will only be considered
if the mode name did not match an algorithmic name. Thus, e.g. "DblPAL:High
Res" will use the algorithmic name, while "Multiscan:Productivity" will use
the normal mode name. The @{b}NORMALNAMES@{ub} switch can be used to change
this behaviour (Visage will then check the display database name
first).@{_opar}

@{u}@{b}MONITOR@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

With this parameter you can easily promote the pictures to display to any
available monitor, providing it is capable of displaying the picture.@{par}

Simply specify the name of the monitor, or a pattern for the monitor(s),
and Visage will look through the display database for any matches. If
found, the picture will be promoted to use one of the specified monitors,
if possible. If several monitors matched the pattern, the BestModeID()
function will select the monitor it considers to be the best one to display
the picture, or if they are equally good, the first "best" mode will be
used.@{par}

You can also specify the special name @{b}REQUEST@{ub} or @{b}?@{ub}, to
get a requester containing the available monitors (except for the so called
default monitor). Note that the properties window will not contain useful
information, except for the frequencies for the native Amiga modes. You can
currently not select more than one monitor in this requester.@{par}

Specifying a valid monitor here will override the
@{b}WBMONITOR@{ub} argument.@{par}

This argument is ignored if a valid @{b}MODE@{ub} has been specified.@{par}

@{u}Note@{uu}:@{_ipar}
The name of a monitor is usually the same as the name of the file in the

@{b}RANDOM@{ub}@{line}

@{u}Note@{uu}:@{_ipar}
When @{b}RANDOM@{ub}, @{b}RANDOMONE@{ub} or @{b}SORT@{ub} order has been

asynchronous IO code (used by the internal (i.e. not datatype) readers).
Two buffers of roughly half the size specified will be allocated, if
possible. Normally this value should not need changes, but you might get
somewhat better performance with other values here (depending on the
media).@{par}

Default is 8 KB. Values below 4 KB are rounded to 4 KB, but the code will
(usually) try with smaller buffers if there is not enough memory
available.@{par}

@{u}Notes@{uu}:@{_ipar}
This buffer size should not be larger that roughly half the average size of
the files you display, or the benefit of "double buffered asynchronous IO"
will be lost.@{par}

These buffers will always be allocated for a picture, even if the
asyncronous code cannot be used to read it (that is, for datatype pictures.
Yet another reason to keep the buffer size "reasonable". ;)@{par}

Thus, all options related to how things are rendered are ignored. However,
screen mode related arguments are not, as the @{b}VERBOSE@{ub} option still

This switch is in many ways similar to the @{b}TEST@{ub} switch. The two
major differences are that the picture is not loaded at all, and that

This switch overrides @{b}TEST@{ub} and @{b}QUIET@{ub}, if they are

attempting to parse any patterns in the name.@{par}

This behaviour is needed, since at this stage Visage does not know if the
file was specified in the @{b}FILES@{ub} argument or if it was a
multiselected icon, as a result of the generic argument parsing functions
used. To work around this problem, Visage will check if the name actually

There is a certain confusion regarding this flag and its use. Because of

If this switch is specified, then Visage will not make certain assumptions
about the contents of the display database (i.e. that a certain flag will
be set for all non native Amiga modes). This assumption makes Visage work
slightly better (i.e. work faster or use less memory) when displaying
pictures in a native Amiga mode.@{par}

However, (partly) due to bugs in the current system software, this
assumption is not (always?) correct when a graphics card is installed, and
this can lead to problems. Thus, if Visage seems to be unable to display a
picture on a "graphics card screen mode", then you should try this
option.@{par}

Thanks to a new way handling things (in Visage 39.2), this switch should
not be needed, but I find it best to make no such assumptions! ;) Also,

If this switch is specified, then Visage will not actually display the

from errors. When all files have been tested, Visage will print out a
status message, showing if any picture contained any error. Also, if there
was any error, the WARN flag will be set.@{par}

For each file that failed with a "data" error, an error message will be
printed, and the @{b}COMMAND@{ub} will be executed (if a command was
specified). Errors caused by external things (such as out of memory) are
not considered here. Please note that this does not necessarily apply to
JPG and PNG pictures.@{par}

If this switch is specified, then many other switches and arguments will be
ignored.@{par}

If @{b}INFO@{ub} is specified as well, then this switch will be
ignored.@{par}

@{u}Notes@{uu}:@{_ipar}
Only certain errors causes Visage to treat it as a bad. I.e. exit with the
WARN flag and execute the command. All errors returned by libjpg and libpng
are treated as if the picture was "bad".@{par}

Even if a picture "fails", it might still be more or less viewable
(e.g., it is not a major problem the error occurred while loading
the last few pixel lines of the picture). Conversely, the fact that
a picture passes the testing does not mean that the picture is free
from trashed graphics.@{par}

It seems like most datatypes does not return any error, even if the picture
contained detectable errors. Thus, you should use the
@{b}NODATATYPES@{ub} option to make sure that this does not happen.@{_opar}

An algorithmic name is a name that is built out of information available in

But why have different names? Well, the reason is rather simple actually.
The display database only contains names for relatively few screen modes¹.

@{u}@{b}Mode name notes@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

It is usually not that important to specify the right special mode. If a
special mode is needed, but not specified, then Visage will try to find a
suitable replacement mode.@{par}

The strings will be translated if a suitable catalog is installed and used,
but Visage will always understand the English strings listed above. Also
note that the monitor name is never translated.@{par}

The algorithmic names are only suitable for native Amiga modes. Visage is
currently only capable of detecting CyberGraphX modes, and will use a name
consisting of the monitor name, width, height and depth (e.g.
"CYBERGRAPHX:800x600x16"). For graphics cards with other emulation
software, I reccommend the use of the @{b}NORMALNAMES@{ub} switch.@{par}

@node RENDERED "Visage.guide/Rendered pictures"
@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}Rendered pictures@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

A rendered picture is simply a picture that Visage must do more with, apart
from reading - and possibly unpacking - the data, in order to be able to
display it. Some picture formats (e.g. JPEG and PNG) are not stored in the
normal Amiga bitmap format, and must therefore be converted. Others are in
bitmap form, but your Amiga might not be able to display them "as is"
anyway (e.g. 24-bit IFF ILBM pictures). These must be converted as
well.@{par}

The rendering of such pictures can be controlled by using the
@{b}COLOR@{ub}, @{b}SCALE@{ub} and @{b}DITHER@{ub} options (and the ECS
option).@{par}

Datatype pictures are a special case: If the system is not capable of
correctly displaying a datatype picture, Visage will rerender it to a
displayable format. If the system is capable of showing it, no rerender
will be done, as this process costs rather much time and memory.@{_ipar}

@{u}CyberGraphX@{uu}@{_opar}

Things becomes a bit different if CyberGraphX is installed. Visage should
be able to display pictures without the above mentioned "rendering"
(rather, it is bitmapped pictures that needs rerender for CyberGraphX
screens, but that is handled by CyberGraphX, not Visage).@{par}

Visage will by default use the "best" available CyberGraphX screen mode. To
change this, use the @{b}COLOR@{ub} argument.@{par}

@{b}Visage_Slideshow.dopus@{ub} - Written by Leo Davidson@{_ipar}

Use Visage to show slideshows in Directory Opus 5. There are two versions

The normal Delete command in AmigaOS can not delete a soft link, if the
target for the soft link has been deleted. The Delete command tries to
"lock" the file to be deleted, in order to get some information about it
(e.g. if it is a drawer or not). For soft links, this locking also means
that the link will be resolved; i.e. the OS tries to lock the link target,
as well as the link itself. If the target file doesn't exist, the locking
fails. As a result, Delete thinks that there is no file to delete, and
quits.@{par}

DeleteLink avoids that problem by "blindly" trying to delete the file,
without first locking it.@{_OParAD}

    @{b}DESCRIPTION@{ub}@{_IParAD}

Creates a file on a disk that is a pointer to another file. When an
application or command calls the FROM file, the TO file is actually used.
By default, MakeLink makes hard links - the FROM and TO files must both be
on the same volume.@{par}

To make soft links - which can cross volumes - the SOFT keyword must be
specified. This might not be supported by all filesystems or OS
versions.@{par}

Normally, MakeLink does not support drawer links, as they can be dangerous
to applications. To create a drawer link you must use the FORCE option. If
MakeLink detects that you are creating a circular link, such as a link to a
parent drawer, you will receive a Link loop not allowed message.@{_OParAD}


    @{b}OPTIONS@{ub}@{_IParAD}

TO@{_IParAD2}

HARD@{_IParAD2}
Create a hard link. Hard links can only point to files or drawers on the
same volume. This is the default.@{_OParAD2}

SOFT@{_IParAD2}
Create a soft link. Soft links can point to files or drawers on other
volumes.@{_OParAD2}

FORCE@{_IParAD2}
You must specify this in order to make a drawer link.@{_OParAD}


    @{b}NOTES@{ub}@{_IParAD}

MakeLink requires OS 3.0 or better to operate, as soft links are said to
not be fully supported in earlier OS versions.@{par}

OS 3.0 seems to only allow the creation of soft directory links. OS 3.1
supports soft file links as well.@{par}

Not all programs support soft links. Especially soft file links can cause
problems, and may for example show up as a directory.@{par}

Using soft links can be a bit tricky. If you delete the file/directory the
soft link points at, then not all programs will be able to delete it. In
that case, you have to create the file the link points to, and then delete
the link (and finally the file). Or you could use the included
@{" DeleteLink " link DELETELINK} program.@{par}

The complete path to soft links (including the file name) can not be more
than 256 chars long, due to limitations in the current OS version. If you
try to create the link anyway, you will get a nonfunctional link.@{_OParAD}

Some pictures have a strange aspect stored in the file. Thus, if you do get
a strange aspect for a picture, this is the most likely explanation (or
maybe your Amiga does not have a screen mode with a proper aspect).@{par}

If you have a graphics card, it is possible that the display database
contains improper values (for the modes provided by the graphic card). The
internal BestModeID() function is very strict when it comes to the aspect,
so this should not be the source of the problem.@{par}

@{u}@{b}Graphic cards@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

As I only own one graphics card, it is a bit tricky to ensure that Visage
really works with all the different "Intuition emulators" available.@{par}

One important thing to remember is that you should use the
@{b}COLOR@{ub} argument, to change how deep pictures should be rendered,
and possibly the @{b}DITHER@{ub} argument as well.@{par}

Here is a list over how the most common emulators behaves (according to the
reports I have got! ;):@{_ipar}

@{b}EGS@{ub}@{line}
Pictures are displayed properly. However, it seems like the background
loading does not work. The @{b}LOWMEM@{ub} or @{b}LATELOAD@{ub} option
should be specified in that case. No high- or truecolor render.@{par}

@{b}Picasso@{ub}@{line}
No known serious problems. Possibly some trashed graphics at the right side
of the picture (but hopefully not). Please note that the
@{b}NOFOREIGN@{ub} switch might be needed for Visage to work properly (i.e.
not crash ;). No high- or truecolor render, unless the Picasso96
CyberGraphX API is installed. (Note that I have not tested Picasso
myself.)@{par}

@{b}Picasso96@{ub}@{line}
Works quite well, but there are a few minor problems. The algoritmic mode
names look a bit odd, so using @{b}NORMALNAMES@{ub} could be a good idea.
The @{b}WBMONITOR@{ub} switch does not work as intended; use @{b}MONITOR
#?<Name>#?@{ub}, where <Name> is the name of your graphics card as seen in
e.g. Picasso96Mode, to get the same effect.@{par}

@{b}CyberGraphX@{ub}@{line}
Version 3 works quite well, though you should avoid using the
@{b}CENTER@{ub} option, as this (new) part does not work that well yet.
Specifying @{b}LOWMEM@{ub} reduces the problems, but does not completely
remove them. Version 2 should work as well, but I have not tested this
myself.@{_opar}

I have not been able to trace any of the above problems to bugs in Visage
(maybe some of the problems can be avoided, if I only knew how ;). It
should be noted that other versions of the emulation software may work
differently.@{par}

@node LACE_PNG_JPG "Visage.guide/Notes/Interlaced PNG and JPEG pictures"
@toc NOTES
@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}Interlaced PNG and JPEG pictures@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

PNG and JPEG both support "interlaced" pictures (the JPEG term is
progressive), where the picture is first drawn very roughly, with the
details being filled in later. In order to do this, the picture is rendered
in several passes, where each pass increases the displayed detail
level.@{par}

Visage will render these pictures this way, but since the rendering process
can be rather slow - especially for truecolor pictures rendered in HAM -
only every other display pass will actually be rendered. This means that
there can be a (small) delay between two rendering passes (especially for
the final pass for PNG pictures). On the other hand, the total render time
can decrease significantly.@{par}

Also, this kind of interlaced pictures can require quite a bit of memory to
load. This especially true for PNG pictures, since a full size copy of the
picture data - in uncompressed form - must be available during load, apart
from the actual screen data.@{par}

So, if you have a truecolor picture of, say, 640×480 pixels, Visage needs
an image buffer of 640 * 480 * 3 = 933,120 bytes, plus some additional
overhead. This image buffer currently needs to be in one continous memory
block.@{par}

JPEG pictures needs some extra memory as well, but I do not know how much,
nor how it is handled internally.@{par}

@node MOUSE_JUMP "Visage.guide/Notes/Mouse jumping"

@{u}@{b}Mouse jumping@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

During picture loading (especially in the background), the mouse pointer
"jumps" a little horizontally. I do not know if this is specific to my
computer (and all my background utilities), but it does happen for other
picture viewers as well.@{par}

I do not know why this happens; if it is due to a bug in Visage (not
likely, considering that other programs have similar "problems", and it is
only visible for native Amiga screen modes) or what. It seems to be
harmless though.@{par}

@node PIPE_READ "Visage.guide/Notes/Pipe reading"
@toc NOTES
@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}Pipe reading@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

Most of the time, Visage should be able to read and display data from a
(named) pipe. However, there are a couple of side effects you should be
aware of:@{_ipar}

@{b}1.@{ub}@{line}
Pipe reading does not work for datatype pictures, but will probably work
for Xpk-compressed pictures (but not PowerPacked pictures), if
xpkmaster.library version 3 or higher is installed. There is nothing that
can be done about this at the moment. As a result, it could be a good idea
to use the @{b}NODATATYPES@{ub} switch, just in case, if you want to use
this feature.@{par}

@{b}2.@{ub}@{line}
Visage will always keep the asyncronous buffers allocated, even if they are
not used. This is not really possible to do something about, due to some
internal details and interactions between some of the arguments
available.@{par}

@{b}3.@{ub}@{line}
As a result of the above, you should not use very large values for the
buffer size (the @{b}BUFSIZE@{ub} argument), as it would waste memory for
the picture types mentioned in point one. You should not have very large
buffers anyway (say, more than 64 KB or so), as they cost memory, and does
not give very good results.@{_opar}

@node PNG_SUPPORT "Visage.guide/Notes/PNG support"

Visage should be able to display just about any valid PNG picture
available. It also supports every important part of the PNG specification,
including gamma correction, transparancy handling and alpha channel
processing. There is only one omission worth mentioning:@{par}

PNG allows various kinds of text information to be stored with the picture,
and this information should be displayed when the picture is viewed. For
now, Visage will ignore this.@{par}

Another thing worth mentioning is that the creation of the gamma correction
tables for PNG pictures with 16 bits per channel can take a fairly large
amount of time. However, such pictures should not be that common anyway. ;)
This delay could perhaps be removed, but it requires (fairly large) changes
in libpng.@{par}

@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}Tooltypes ignored@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

It is possible that the tooltypes specified in the Visage icon are ignored.
This can happen if you e.g. double click on an icon that has Visage as the
default tool. If the Workbench needs to search the command path for Visage,
it will then pass on information that makes Visage believe that the program
is located in the same drawer as the project icon, which is not the case.
Seems to be a Workbench bug if you ask me. ;) I do not know which versions
of Workbench that have this problem. 3.1 (40.5) has it at least.@{par}

To work around this problem, select the project icon, and double click on
the Visage icon with shift pressed, or make sure the project icon contains
the full path to Visage.@{par}

@node TODO "Visage.guide/The future"
@{_ipar}
@{u}@{b}The future@{ub}@{uu}@{_opar}

There are a several things that could be improved or implemented. These are
things I (or a user or beta tester) have though of during the development,
but did not get implemented, either due to lack of information, time,
"interest" (i.e. if I thought it could be useful) or something
similar.@{par}

Anyway, here is a list over the more important ones:@{_ipar}

Improve the quality of rendered "deep" pictures in ECS modes. Code that
detects grayscale pictures could be nice. Future versions of the libpng
code might help as well (the current code is too slow).@{par}

A GUI mode, to make Visage easier to use, especially from the Workbench.
This would probably mean a set of menus, and slightly different behaviour
(when the mode is enabled).@{par}

Load more than one picture in the background (similar to FV).@{_opar}

And a few minor ones:@{_ipar}

Break Visage up into modules loaded on demand. Mostly useful for the JPEG
and PNG picture loaders, but it could allow for further picture formats to
be added easily. Work in this direction has been started, but nothing is
certain yet.@{par}

Internal multitasking. This would mean that Visage would better respond to
e.g. cursor keys, while loading a datatype picture.@{_opar}

If you have any suggestions on what you think should be implemented, feel
free to contact @{" me " link AUTHOR}.@{par}

I have no immediate plans to add the following:@{_ipar}

Animation support. I suggest you use a dedicated animation viewer
instead.@{par}

More picture formats. Maybe a few more formats will be added, but I do not
know of any other right now (and using datatypes is much better for "odd"
formats anyway).@{_opar}

@{b}Wessel Dankers@{ub}@{line}
The MergeList() function (as posted in comp.sys.amiga.programmer).@{par}

@{b}Günther Röhrich@{ub}@{line}
His ideas and suggestions, and the help he gave me about his HAM encoding
function, although I decided to not use it.@{par}

@{b}Lars Eilebrecht@{ub}@{line}
DoIconLite, which was used during the installation in earlier versions of
Visage. I replaced it with a program written by myself, since DoIconLite
did not quite work the way I wanted.@{par}

@{b}Phil Vedovatti@{ub}@{line}
The nice NewIcons.@{par}

@{b}John Hendrikx@{ub}@{line}
The chunky to planar conversion routines (sorry, the planar to chunky
functions are not flexible enough ;).@{par}

@{b}Lee Kindness@{ub}@{line}
Umentiler, and being kind (!) enough to implement my specific requests, so
that I don't need to mess around with ARexx scipts and environment
variables to process this manual.@{par}

Beta testing (during one time or another).@{par}

@{b}Mathias Karlsson@{ub}@{line}
A special thanks for suggesting the name of this program.@{par}

(Side note: The working name of this program was PicView, but when Holger
Papajewski released his picture catalog manager with that name, I was
forced to rename my program, soon before releasing the first version. I
really wanted a better name than PicView, and this forced me to find one
quickly. ;)@{_opar}

Finally, I would like to thank everyone who has sent me a message, with bug
reports, comments or similar. A very special thanks to those (rather few,
I'm afraid ;) who have sent me a donation. All this encourages me to
continue working on Visage.@{par}

The latest version of Visage is available for download from my home page.
There you can also find some information about me, and other programs I
have written.@{par}

If you send me a translation in an attached file (and you only need to send
the catalog translation (.ct) file. I create the catalog automatically
anyway), please use a file name similar to "Visage<Language>#?". It is not
that important really, but that way I do not need to rename it the first
thing I do. ;)@{par}

If you send me a bug report, please read the relevant sections of this
manual first (mainly the @{" argument " link ARGUMENTS} section if
suitable, and the @{" notes " link NOTES} section). Many known "problems"
(or features ;) are mentioned there.@{par}

Also, please include some basic system information with your bug report (OS
version, CPU type and graphics subsystem are of main interest). If the
problem only occurs under certain conditions (e.g. a certain picture type
or size, or certain arguments), please specify this as well. Thank
you.@{par}
