INTRODUCTION
------------
        
        This program was originally written due to the lack of such a 
        program  on the Amiga.  Since that time the response has been
        terrific.  SysInfo is now even more powerful and has become
        a standard on the Amiga.
        
        I have placed this program on Shareware so that it can be
        used by everyone.  All code, graphics and documents remain
        copyright Nic Wilson Software.
        
        If you like this program, then help me to help you more by
        sending a donation.

                      *********************************            
                      IMPORTANT FOR KICKSTART 1.2 - 1.3
                      *********************************
                      
        Amigas that have a maths co-processor using kickstart 1.3 or 
        earlier, MUST use SetPatch 1.34 or later otherwise this program
        will crash.  This program uses 68881 & 68882 instructions and a 
        bug in the kernal causes a guru.  SetPatch patches this bug.  
        This is not required for Kickstart V2.04 or greater.
        
        Sysinfo is an Amiga Sytem Information program.  It interrogates
        the Amiga and determines types of hardware, software, modes,
        speed etc.  Users have found it very useful for determining
        correct operation of an Amiga before purchase and that the
        unit actually contains hardware that they are paying for, without
        having to open it up.  It is under constant revision, and these
        revisions are available from myself at any time.  My goal is to
        make SysInfo the most informative and accurate information program
        on the Amiga.  To do this I need your feedback and suggestions. 
        
        This program is tested with the program 'Enforcer'.
        
        Please be patient if you are running SysInfo on a standard
        Amiga as it will take a while to perform its tests.  SysInfo
        really interrogates your system and has to perform many timing
        loops to test ram speed, type etc.  Some other programs sacrifice
        accuracy by speeding the tests up, SysInfo takes time but does
        an intensive test.  At times it also disables multitasking and may
        blank the mouse pointer.  It will return to multitasking when
        finished and the mouse pointer will return.
        
        TIMINGS FROM ONE VERSION OF SYSINFO TO THE NEXT
        -----------------------------------------------
        
        If you are wondering how come SysInfo may give different results
        from one version to the next, this is because it is under 
        constant revision and accuracy is improved with each version as
        YOU THE USER gives me feedback on varying models and 
        configurations.  This feedback is very important, as it allows
        SysInfo to grow into the most powerful and accurate System
        information program and an invaluable tool for the Amiga.
                
USAGE   
-----
     FROM CLI
     --------
        run SysInfo <switch>
                
<switch>        -p    Print info to standard redirection output
                      instead of custom screen.
                      EG.  SysInfo >prt: -p     (for printer)
                           SysInfo -p           (for CLI window)
                           SysInfo >filename -p (for a file)
                                
                -t    Mainly for internal, time testing use. 
                      See 'NOTE ON SPEED COMPARISONS' below.    
                      The custom screen will still open to keep
                      the timing accurate, but no information will
                      be printed to it.  On completion the screen
                      will close and the information printed on the
                      CLI window or redirected output.
                      
     FROM WORKBENCH
     --------------
        Double click the SysInfo icon.  After launch and various information
        has been printed to the window you will be able to access one of the
        eight gadgets on the main window.  These are QUIT, MEMORY, BOARDS, 
        DRIVES, SPEED, PRINT, LIBRARIES, and EXPAND.  At the top of the window 
        in the SOFTWARE section, there is a proportional gadget for scrolling
        the software display.  The 'DHRY' gadget is not used at this time and
        is planned for different tests in future versions.
        
    GADGETS
    -------    
        
        
LIBRARY This gadget toggles the SOFTWARE display between libraries,
	device drivers, resources, ports and Tasks.  The proportional gadget 
	to the right of the display allows you to scroll through the list if 
	there is more that will fit on the screen at one time.
	
EXPAND  This gadget toggles between expand and 'SHRINK'.  This allows the
	graph area to be expanded, using a smaller scale.  This permits
	users of slower Amigas to more easily see the differences.  The
	scales are 0 - 40 thousand dhrystones and 0 - 10 thousand dhrystones
	respectively.  If one of the graphic bars is too large for display
	on the expanded scale, it will be shown as full size with a plus (+)
	sign on the very right of the display bar.
		
DHRY    At this point in time, this gadget does not function.  I am planning
	different types of tests that will be available from this gadget.	
        
QUIT    Does just that, exits the program completely. 

SPEED   Runs the speed comparisons and displays the result accordingly. 
        This can be selected as many times as you wish so the results
        can be averaged.  
        
PRINT   Will open a window and prompt for a filename and an optional
        heading string,  This heading string will be printed at the
        top of the page and can have a maximum of 100 characters.
        
        Enter a path and filename to save to, or to choose the default 
        'PRT:' for output to a printer by clicking the 'OK' gadget.
        
MEMORY  Is explained below

BOARDS  Is explained below. 

DRIVES GADGET
-------------
        When this gadget is clicked another window will open and display
        a gadget for each floppy, hard or rad drive you have connected
        to your Amiga.  In the middle of the window you will see Information
        on the particular drive that has its gadget highlighted.  To select
        a particular drive, just click on its gadget.  To re-read the same
        drive, click in its gadget again (useful for re-reading a floppy
        after a disk change).
    
    SCSI GADGET
    -----------                                   
                NOTE This function may not work on some brands device
                ---- drivers and may possibly crash on others.  This is
                     due to the fact it may not support the required 
                     commands.  If this happens you may just see an 
                     error message in the window for each device it 
                     found that failed to respond to the direct scsi 
                     command. Each device's unit number will still be
                     displayed at the start of each error string under
                     the 'ID' heading.  In this case contact the  
                     manufacturer of your hard disk controller and 
                     enquire if they have an update that supports CBM's 
                     'HD_SCSICMD' command and RigidDiskBlock structure.
                     

        This gadget will be ghosted for drives that are obviously not
        SCSI drives,  The SCSI function will display info on all drives
        that are operated through a single device driver, there is 
        no need to click the SCSI gadget for all drives, unless some
        use a different device driver name as shown in the 'drives window'.
        Select one of the drives and click the SCSI gadget.  A new window
        will open an attempt to read all SCSI drives on LUN (Logical Unit
        Number) zero.  If valid drive is found, various information will be
        displayed.  This information consists of the drive 'ID', its 'TYPE',
        the 'MANUFACTURER', 'MODEL', and 'VERSION'.  Also displayed is the
        ANSI version of the device and the number of blocks the drive has.  
        
        The drive's REAL size is displayed and if the drive supports CBM's
        RigidDiskBlock, the formatted size is also displayed beside the 
        actual size.  This allows you to see if a larger drive than you 
        thought you had is in the computer.  I have seen some A2500's with 
        a formatted size of 40MB that actually had QUANTUM 52 Meg hard drive.  
        
        If your drive's supplier has not followed CBM's RigidDiskBlock then 
        the formatted size will not be displayed, but most users already know 
        the size they beleive is in the system.  If these sizes are different 
        then your hard drive will require partitioning and re-formatting 
        correctly.  If the 'REAL' size is smaller than your formatted size then you will 
        eventually have problems so your drive will still need formatting 
        correctly.  
        
        It is often the case that the REAL size will be 1MB larger than
        FORMATTED.  This is normal and due to the fact that the chosen
        number of cylinder, heads etc, will hardly ever exactly match the 
        total block available on the disk, and this remainder can somtimes
        show up on the REAL display, if it is large enough.
        
    SPEED
    -----
    
    	This gadget will perform a 'read' speed test on the selected 
    	drive.  It is very safe as it does not write at all.  The result
    	of the test is displayed on the last line.  Timing for this test
    	is done via timer.device for best accuracy. The test can be done
    	on any drive in the gadget list.  To test a particular drive, select
    	its gadget and then click the 'SPEED' gadget.  If a floppy is selected, 
    	and it does not have a disk in the drive, or the particular drive 
    	cannot be 'locked' for some reason, the SPEED gadget will be ghosted,
    	and not selectable.
    	
    	The size and length of the test, depends on the partition or disk.
    	The entire drive will be read, unless the partition is 15megs or 
    	greater, in those cases, 7 megs will will be read.  I have found 
    	that reading more that this is not necessary as the results do not 
    	change significantly. 
    	
    	This function has been tested all forms of drives on various
    	Amigas, including the CDROM drive in the CDTV, and the IDE drive
    	in the A600.
        

BOARDS GADGET
-------------
        When this gadget is clicked another window will open and display
        various information on any AutoConfig  boards found in the
        system.  This information consists of the memory address of where
        the board was configured, its size, and the type of board.  The
        types to date, can be ZORRO II or ZORRO III, any others are
        not yet defined by Commodore and will be displayed as UNDEFINED.
        The boards Product number, manufactures ID and the serial
        number will also be displayed.  If SysInfo recognises the 
        manufacturer of the card and or the product itself it will display 
        the names instead of the numbers.  Note that a standard A3000 has 
        no AutoConfigure  boards as such,  its extra hardware is known 
        by the special Kickstart files and its memory and hard drive are 
        added to the system by this kickstart.  A2000 users using zkick to 
        load V2.0 will also notice that their memory boards will not show 
        in the AutoConfig list, as they were actually configured by 1.3 and 
        zkick patches them in to the memory list. 
        
LEARN ABILITY
-------------
	If Sysinfo does not recognise a board by name, it used to only
	print the Manufacturer and Product numbers.  Since version
	3.22 it now looks in an external file (if it exists) in  the S: 
	directory called "sysinfo.boards" in an attempt to match each of 
	these unknown board numbers with strings that you have supplied 
	within the file.
 
	
CREATING THE EXTERNAL BOARD IDENTIFICATION FILE
-----------------------------------------------

	The file *MUST* be called sysinfo.boards and *MUST* be in
	the S: directory.

	The file must have a strict specific format as shown below.

	Comments are allowed but *MUST* only be at the top of the file,
	and the first character on the beginning of each line *MUST*
	be a semi-colon (;)  Blank lines are not allowed and will cause
	errors unless preceded with a semi-colon. 

	Each different board must be on a new line and the
	manufacturer must be given for each product number, even
	if they are the same.  For example, Commodore cards are
	known by Sysinfo, but if they were not, and you had a 
	A2091 card, Sysinfo would have displayed it as Manufacturer 514
	and Product 3, and the memory portion of the board as 
	Manufacturer 514 with Product 10.  These two entries would
	be in the ascii file as :-

514 COMMODORE 3 A2901/A590
514 COMMODORE 10 A2091-MEMORY

	See the example sysinfo.boards file with this archive
	for a complete working example.

	***************
	***IMPORTANT***
	***************

	Each name that follows each number **MUST** not contain 
	spaces, if you want to seperate two names then use
	hyphens, periods or slashes etc., as shown in the example 
	above. The total length of the name strings for both manufacturer
	and product should not be greater than 13 characters else
	overwriting may occur.	

	There must be at least one space between each of the numbers 
	and the name strings on every line, as these are used
	as delimiters for seperating numbers from the names and also 
	used to null terminate the strings for printing. 

MEMORY GADGET
-------------
        When this gadget is clicked another window will open and display
        various information on any memory in the system.  The first section
        displayed will be the first memory section that was configured by
        the system.  At the bottom left of the display are two gadgets,
        'NEXT' and 'EXIT'.  The next gadget changes the display to show the
        next memory section, until no more sections are found.  At that time
        the window will close and return to the main window.  The exit gadget
        exits immediately to the main window.
        

SPEED COMPARISONS
-----------------
        If SysInfo does not have a test that you would like to see, let
        me know and I will do my best to add it in for you.
	
        THE SPEED COMPARISON CODE HAS BEEN WRITTEN TO GIVE A FAIR INDICATION
        OF THE SPEED OF A PARTICULAR AMIGA.  IT USES A COMBINATION OF ALL
        MOTOROLA INSTRUCTIONS TO BOTH REGISTERS AND MEMORY IN A PERCENTAGE
        THAT POPULAR AMIGA PROGRAMS AND COMPILERS HAVE USED. 

        The A500 - A600 STD comparison is against a PAL A500 or A600 totally 
        unexpanded or expanded to 1 Meg chip only (ie. no Fast Ram).

        The B2000 EXTRA RAM comparison is against a PAL B2000 Rev 4.4 with
        a Microbotics 8-UP Fast Ram board fitted with 80ns DRAMS. 
        
        The A1200 68EC020 comparison is against a standard PAL A1200 as
        shipped from Commodore with cache enabled. The reason for the
        difference in speed to the A2500, is because the A1200 is shipped
        with CHIP ram only.  There will be a significant speed increase
        when fast memory is added, especially 32 bit memory such as the
        Microbotics MBX 1200 board.
        
        The A2620 comparison is against a standard A2500 with a A2620
        card running at 14.3 MHZ.  All caches and bursts on.
        
        The A3000 25 MHZ comparison is against a standard PAL A3000/25 MHZ
        with 4 Megs of 1MX4 SCRAMS 80ns 32 bit wide, and 2 Megs of CHIP. 
        Caches and Bursts on except Data Burst (default under V2.04 V37+).   
        Ramsey mode was set at default, BURST ON and STATIC COLUMN OFF.
        
        The A4000/040 25MHZ is against a standard PAL A4000 with the
        standard configuration of 2 Meg Chip and 4 Meg Fast memory.
        All cache modes are at boot default under 68040.library 37.10
        under AmigaDOS V3.00 - Kickstart 39.106, with setpatch 39.7 
        installed.
                                                                     
        CPU MIPS (Million Instructions per Second) This test calculation
        has been coded from all information I have been able to find
        to date.  It seems quite debatable how this is supposed to be
        coded and I received different information from people.  It does 
        a very large loop performing a total of 4.25 million instructions
        ranging from general instructions, divide, multiply, logic shifts,
        rotations etc.  I CANNOT AND DO NOT GUARANTEE ITS ACCURACY, except
        to say it is accurate to the point, it did do the number of 
        instructions per second that it stated.  Comments on this approach 
        or a better one are most welcome.
        
        FPU MFLOPS (Million Floating Operations per Second)  This test
        calculation was similar to the above one, in that information
        on the recognised way was very sketchy.  If an Amiga does not
        have an FPU, N/A will be shown in this field as any performance
        test would be meaningless.  The final code shows known boards
        to be at or around thier advertised speeds.  It does a very large
        loop performing instructions that take an average number of 
        clock cycles, times the loop then displays the result.  I CANNOT 
        AND DO NOT GUARANTEE ITS ACCURACY.  If anyone has a better 
        routine for this I would be very interested.  This routine is
        not compatible with a 68881 on a 68000 system such as the Phoenix
        board and will show N/A.

CACHE GADGETS
-------------
	These gadgets require AmigaDOS V2.0 or later, otherwise all
	the gadgets will be ghosted and unavailable.
	
	These are a group of six gadgets.  Modes that are unavailable
	for the CPU type fitted in your Amiga, will be ghosted and
	not available.  Clicking these gadgets changes the cache modes
	for the Instruction and Data caches of the CPU and allows you
	to compare the difference in speed with different cache
	settings.
	
	The 'ALL' toggle gadget (lower right side) inverts all settings
	from their current state and vice versa.
	
	Some cache manipulation will still be done automatically by the 
	program for some tests (IE. MHZ test).  Caches will always be 
	enabled temporarily for test such as this, otherwise the results 
	would be meaningless.
	
	-------------------------------------------------------
	Remember that if you disable the caches and then exit
	the proram before enabling them again, they will still
	be off and you will need to re-enable them will the CPU
	command or such.
	-------------------------------------------------------
	
	A4000 and other 68040 OWNERS NOTE
	---------------------------------
	
	Under 37.10 and greater of 68040.library it is no longer
	possible to turn CopyBack off.  If you click the gadget you
	will notice that the mode does not change.  This is normal.
	However as CopyBack is a Data Cache mode, if the Data Cache is 
	off, the CopyBack setting has no effect.
	
INTERNAL HARDWARE
-----------------
        This shows internal harware as the program has found it.
        
        HARDWARE CLOCK only looks for the standard A500, A600, A2000,
        A3000, CDTV  or fully compatible hardware clock.  It does not look 
        for the multitude of different clocks that were available for 
        the 1000 or other models.

        DMA/Gfx  This will show all current versions of Agnus, and the
        newer Alice chip.  ECS stands for ENHANCED CHIP SET. 
        The program is also able to tell the difference between the 1MB & 
        2MB versions of Super Agnus.  Many users have queried the possibility 
        of doing this and they beleive I check the memory amount.  The 1MB 
        and the 2MB Agnus chips do not have any different signature registers 
        so in order to tell them apart I used a trick of the hardware design.  
        The 1MB Agnus only decodes the first meg space and so the second meg 
        space has a 'ghost' image of the first.  A 2MB Agnus does decode the 
        second meg space so no ghost image is present.  SysInfo checks for this 
        and reports the difference.  This theory I beleive is quite sound, and 
        has been tested on many 1MB and 2MB Amiga's. 
        
        MODE  This shows the current display MODE.  Under kickstart 1.2 or 1.3
        this will show either PAL or NTSC.  Under version 2.04+ is has the
        capability of showing all the various modes.  This will mainly be
        the case using the '-p' option of SysInfo.  This is because of the
        custom screen that SysInfo uses will normally force the display back
        to your default mode, except for AGA Amigas that have 'Promotion'
        enabled, this will usually force the Sysinfo screen to DBLPAL or
        DBLNTSC mode.  This will be reflected in the screen display.
        
        CPU's  68000, 68010, 68020, 68030 and 68040 are supported
        and will be displayed if found.  If Exec is incorrect then
        a window will open, and ask you if you want exec to be updated
        to reflect the correct hardware.  This is mainly for Kickstart
        1.3, as it is not normally aware of later processors.
        
        FPU's or Floating Point Units 68881 and 68882 and internal 68040
        are supported and will be displayed if found.  These chips are 
        also often referred to as maths co-processors.  Wether or not you 
        have one is tested by the program, and if Exec is incorrect a 
        window will open and ask you if you want Exec corrected. 
        If a 68040 is found and a CORRECTLY working 68882 emulation then
        the FPU string will show '68040+68882'.  If yours does not show
        this then contact your board manufacturer and ask for a copy
        of Commodore's V37.4 (or greater) 68040 software. 

        MMU's or Memory Management Units 68851 or the internal 68030 and
        68040 are supported.  These are actually tested for as Exec does not 
        carry this info.  The 68451 never became very popular so is not 
        supported.  It will also reflect if the MMU is currently enabled
        or disabled.
        
        VBR is the Vector Base Register.  This is applicable to all processors
        except the 68000.  The VBR contains the base address of the exception 
        vector table in memory.  The displacement of an exception vector is 
        added to the value in this register to access the vector table.  On 
        the 68000 processor the vector table is always located at address zero.  
        
        MHZ is a rough indication of the clock speed.  This is not totally 
        accurate but is a good indication.  It at least allows you to know 
        if your system is 7MHZ, 16MHZ or 25MHZ etc.  All caches, bursts and 
        copyback modes are temporarily enabled during the test for greater 
        stability, but this should be transparent to the user and they will 
        be returned to their original state after the tests.  Clock Speed is 
        normally difficult to find out unless you take the unit apart and even 
        then is difficult.  Fast ram must be available for this to be anywhere 
        near accurate, as the timing loops were all based on machines with some 
        Fast ram available.  For a 68000 based Amiga, the program will take into 
        account if no fast ram is available and calculate the correct speed 
        accordingly. 
        
        HORIZ Khz  This is the horizontal scan frequency of the current
        display.  Early kickstarts will show 15.60 for PAL and 15.72 for
        NTSC.   Kickstart 2.04 or above will show correctly the horizontal
        frequency.  This will normally only show other than PAL or NTSC
        when using the '-p' option, because of the reasons specified in the
        MODE description above.
        
        ECLOCK Hz is the frequency of the EClock, as reflected in execbase.
        This clock is used for the CIA chips.
        
        CBACK is an abbreviation for CopyBack.  It is only applicable to 
        the 68040 currently.  This shows if it is enabled or disabled.  This 
        is rather a difficult mode, because with the MMU it is possible that 
        it may be enabled somewhere within the memory map and not others.  
        The test here uses the OS function to determine if it is enabled. 
        CopyBack is a cache mode of the CPU and when enabled, the CPU only 
        updates the cache on writes and memory is only updated when 
        absolutely necessary or it is forced to do so.
        
        INS. CACHE or Instruction Cache is applicable to 68020, 68030 and
        68040 processors.  This shows if it is currently enabled or
        disabled.  
        
        INS. BURST or Instruction Burst is applicable to 68030 processor.  
        This shows if it is currently enabled or disabled.  It will
        however show 'ON' if a 68040 is detected due to requests I received
        from certain 68040 board manufacturers.
        
        DAT. CACHE or Data Cache is only applicable to 68030 and 68040
        processors.  This shows if it is currently enabled or disabled.  
        
        DAT. BURST or Data Burst is only applicable to 68030 processor.  
        This shows if it is currently enabled or disabled.  It will
        however show 'ON' if a 68040 is detected due to requests I received
        from certain 68040 board manufacturers.

        
        **************************************************************
        THE NEXT TWO ARE FOR THE A3000 ONLY. AS I HAVE NOT YET FOUND
        A 100% GUARANTEED WAY TO DETERMINE AN A3000, ON SOME NON-A3000 
        AMIGAS THIS INFORMATION MAY BE DISPLAYED BUT WILL BE USELESS,
        AT THE PRESENT TIME THE PROGRAM LOOKS FOR A WORKING RAMSEY 
        CHIP IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY A 3000 SERIES AMIGA, BUT THIS 
        REQUIRES FURTHER TESTING BEFORE I CAN GUARANTEE ITS ACCURACY.
        **************************************************************
        
        RAMSEY ver is only applicable to the A3000 series of computers.
        It will display the revision value of this chip in hexadecimal.
        Currently there are only two I know of.  Type '$D' is the
        standard A3000 Ramsey and has a bug that causes failure of the
        'Page Detect Mode', the other is '$E'.  This is a newer chip
        that has this bug corrected.
        
        GARY ver is only applicable to the A3000 series of computers,
        even though other Amigas do have a GARY chip, I do not know
        of a way to identify them as I do for the A3000 series.  It will 
        show the revision number in hexadecimal.  Currently there are only
        two I know of, type '$0' is the standard A3000 chip and type
        '$90' which is a newer chip.
        
        CARD SLOT is the new "PCMCIA" card slot in the A600.  SysInfo
        looks for the slot and displays if an A600 style card slot is 
        found.
        
        SUPPLY Hz is the frequency of the power supply as relected in
        Execbase.  This will normally be either 50 or 60 Hz.
        
        VERT Hz is the frequency of the Vertical Frames.  All modes are
        catered for, including the programmable ones of the later custom
        chips.  See the decription for MODE above for restrictions on these
        displays.
        

        THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO ADD
        --------------------------
        
        1. I have been receiving conflicting reports about the AT/XT
           bridgeboards.  Could you please check your card and let
           me know how the current routine works.  I have added the new
           386SX brideboard, but is also untested.  Please report, preferably
           by email.

        3. Your ideas!
        
        If you supply suggestions in code form, I would prefer assembler,
        or C but I can translate other languages if I must.  
                      
                
NOTE ON SPEED COMPARISONS
-------------------------
If you have any of the machines listed above, or even a totally 
different configuration, run the program with -t option (eg. sysinfo -t )
then phone or email with the resulting numbers that will be printed to the 
screen.  My phone number, email address or fax is at the top of this file.
 
                      
Happy Computing
