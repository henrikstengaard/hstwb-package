Introduction to TransWrite

Welcome to TransWrite. Before diving into the program itself, it might help if you understand a bit of the philosophy behind TransWrite. TransWrite is designed as a high-performance alternative to other word processors on the Amiga that are too slow for serious writing and editing work. While it is completely suitable for quick letters, TransWrite will be greatly appreciated by professional writers, editors, and anyone else whose work involves large documents.

Text entry and editing operations have been carefully chosen and implemented for efficiency and simplicity. Document size is limited only by available memory, and there is no speed penalty for large documents. Multiple windows can be used concurrently, working as separate tasks in the Amiga's operating system. TransWrite's new features like translation tables for automated text substitution, document encryption to protect personal or proprietary information, and document analysis make the program even more valuable to the professional writer. The best news for even the casual user, however, is that TransWrite is still easy to use, so that you don't have to do a lot of relearning if you come back to the program after a long absence.

The applications for TransWrite are the same as those of a regular word processor, but TransWrite lends itself especially well to big jobs and professional work where other programs would bog you down: writing a novel, magazine publishing (several magazines use TransWrite as their in-house text editor), and as a preprocessor for desktop publishing and other text-oriented programs. Finally, for the ultimate Amiga desktop publishing system, TransWrite and Professional Page are designed to work together, giving you the benefits of efficient document creation and editing, combined with professional quality typeset output.
