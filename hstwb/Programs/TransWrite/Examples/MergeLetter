Dear ¥4,

     Well, this is it, ¥4!  Yes, even in your pitiful little town of ¥3, pitiful little people like you, ¥1, can still sometimes find an unexpected opportunity to make something worthwhile of your lives! I'm referring, of course, ¥4, to Shark Fin's new All-Atomic Power Toaster - the one you've seen advertised on national TV!

But this deluxe, ultra-advanced, super-convenient unit isn't going to cost you an arm and a leg, ¥4, thanks to this once-in-a-lifetime special offer!  No, you can have it for just a leg (either one), if you act now!



Yours sincerely,




Bert Blot
President and Commander-In-Chief
Shark Fin Enterprises, Inc.



P.S. By the way, ¥4, on a personal note, just want to say how much I love your home city of ¥3!  The wife and I stop there often on our vacations, to take in the lovely scenery and the crazy nightlife. - Bert
