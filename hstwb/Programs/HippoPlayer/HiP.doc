HippoPlayer (HiP) is a multiformat module player for the Amiga.  It works
perfectly under Kickstart 1.2 and has all the same and even more features
than the players requiring Kick2.0+ to run.

One main reason why I started making this program was that there were no
good Kick1.3 compatible players around, or I didn't know of one (that was
back in 1994 when I had an A500).  The other reason was that my good friend
Jarno Paananen (Guru/Sahara Surfers) made a replay routine for
Screamtracker ]I[ modules, and I wanted a good GUI for it.

The aim was to make a good module player that works on every Amiga
configuration and has lot's of useful features.  To achieve speed,
little size and memory usage, HiP is entirely written in assembler.
Project HippoPlayer was started 5.2.1994.

"Newcomers will run screaming away", said Nemesis1.  At first HiP may seem
complicated.  Learn to use HiP, it should be worth the effort :)...

HiP has good support for Screamtracker ]I[, Fasttracker 1 & 2, Taketracker,
and Multitracker modules (from here onwards referred as PS3Ms,
meaning that you can listen them with a 68000 Amiga with listenable
quality.  All are played by the famous replayer by Guru.  HiP was the
second (or was it third?) program to use the PS3M-routines after Guru's own
player.

******************************************************************************
*                           *** Music formats ***		             *
******************************************************************************

Explanation of the list:

Stop/Continue     = 1 - The music can be stopped and continued.
Multiple songs    = 2 - Modules can have more than one song.
Volume            = 3 - Volume can be controlled.
End detect        = 4 - Songend can be detected.
Forward/backward  = 5 - You can jump forwards and backwards in the song.
CIA fast forward  = 6 - Play 2x or 4x faster with LMB/RMB and `>'
AHI support       = 7 - Music can be played thru the AHI device.

The module formats marked with a star (`*') have the replay code inside the
module itself.  I can't guarantee will they work or not.  This is also the
reason why they are not in the player group file (no replay code).

Player group (See Prefs)
------------

Player group (HippoPlayer.group) is a file consisting of the replayers
not included in the main program.  The reason for this is that by moving
seldom used replayers into a separate file, memory usage is reduced by
about 80kB.  Not that much you may think, but maybe just enough to
prevent some actions from happening on low memory systems/situations.  You
can decide where HippoPlayer is to look for the player group file in the
preferences.



Loading files
-------------

Normally all modules will be loaded in CHIP. 

The following formats can be played from FAST RAM and are loaded there if
possible:
- SID
- PS3M
- TFMX (only song data, samples are always in CHIP)
- Oktalyzer 8 channel modules
- OctaMED 8-64 channel modules
- Protracker (only if you have selected PT FAST RAM play)
- DIGI Booster
- THX

· Compressed files are loaded to CHIP and then inspected if they should be
  moved to FAST.

· XPK packed files can be identified by unpacking the first chunk of the
  file.  That hunk will be used to determine whether the module should be
  loaded to FAST.

· LhA, LZX and Zip files can be checked for loading to FAST.


Advantages of loading to FAST:
 · FAST RAM is much faster than CHIP, so mixing and other processing 
   can be done faster.
 · CHIP RAM is saved for other applications.




Protracker
-----------
Protracker is the most popular music format on the Amiga.  HiP features my
own Protracker play routine.

 · Multisong modules
 
   There are some modules around with several songs separated by the B
   command.  HiP allows you to play these kind of modules correctly.  Just
   use the '|<' and '>|' gadgets (or the respective keys) to select
   different songs. The first player on Amiga to support this feature :)

 · Fast RAM player

   This player can play PT modules from FAST RAM using only 1024 bytes of
   CHIP RAM.  Useful for very big modules.  

 · Old Soundracker modules

   HiP identifies old Soundtracker modules and converts them to the
   Protracker format. This will take memory temporarily twice the module
   size, but I don't think it's a big problem because old ST tunes tend to
   be very small.



TFMX
----

HiP can play both 4 and 7-channel TFMX modules, including the excellent
Turrican 1, 2 and 3 intro tunes.  A TFMX module consists of two files.
They must be named `mdat.<name>' and `smpl.<name>'.  To play, select
`mdat.<name>'.  HippoPlayer will then try to load the `smpl.<name>' file.
Alternatively you can use the TFHD format TFMX modules.

The mixing rate of TFMX 7 channel replayer can be changed.  The bigger
value, the better quality and bigger CPU load.  If you lose notes or hear
`crackling' in the sound try lowering the mixing rate in the preferences.



PS3M 0.960/020+ (22.2.1996)
---------------------------
In the term `PS3M', the following formats apply:

 · Screamtracker ]I[
 · Protracker
 · Fasttracker 1 & 2
 · Taketracker
 · Multitracker

Jarno Paananen (Guru/Sahara Surfers) has made replayers for these.  They
have been integrated to a mixing engine which is able to play 1-32 voices
simultaneously by mixing them through four channels.  The routine is
amazingly fast.  Even on Amiga 500 eigth channel modules are very
listenable.  The replayer gobbles quite a bit of memory for its buffers, so
don't be surprised.

Mixing rates can be changed.  Again, the bigger value, the better quality
and bigger CPU load.  Using the system friendly mode on A500 will probably
more or less jam the machine, therefore you should use the killer mode for
the best quality.

PS3M allows mixing rates higher than 28 kHz, which is normally the hardware
limit.  In some AGA (ECS too?) screenmodes higher mixing rates are
possible.  This is what I found out after some experimenting.  I used
maximum overscan.

                 Maximum mixing rates for screenmodes 

                        PAL          28 kHz		
                        NTSC         28 kHz
                        Euro36       28 kHz
                        DblPAL       54 kHz
                        DblNTSC      54 kHz
                        Euro72       58 kHz
                        Multiscan    58 kHz
                        Super72      46 kHz

Note: If you use too high a mixing rate, the sound will be distorted.

The 14-bit mode supports CyberSound calibration for the best possible
quality.

Killer mode will cause Enforcer hits!  It bangs some of the
interrupt vectors.  Don't use Enforcer with killer mode.

These modules can and should be played from FAST RAM.

PS3M can be configured via the preferences or a configuration file.




PS3M configuration file
-----------------------

It is possible to control PS3M via the config file `S:HippoPlayer.PS3M'.
HiP will configure PS3M according to the config file every time a module is
loaded.

In HippoPlayer.PS3M you can enter PS3M settings for each number of channels
and for specific modules.  In channel and song settings you may replace the
number you don't want to alter with ?'s.  Useful when you want to control
the mixing rate from HiP and the volume boost the PS3M from config file.

The file is quite self-explanatory so you should be able to edit it with no
problem.  If you don't want to use the config file you can delete it from
S:  or disable it from prefs.



SID
---
These are tunes ripped from C64 games & demos.  Both normal file + icon and
one file formats are supported.  The playing is done by PlaySID.library by
Håkan Sundell and Ron Birk.  Great job dudes!

*** Note 1:  Under Kickstart 1.2/1.3 playsid.library v1.1 does not work
because it uses some Kick2.0+ functions.  I have made a little patch to
bypass the problem.  This patch works ONLY with lib version v1.1 and
Kick1.2/1.3.

*** Note 2:  If you are using the excellent Executive you should switch it
to use some other timer than CIAB because playsid.library needs the CIAB
timers for playing.



MED
---
HippoPlayer supports different MED formats:  MMD0, MMD1, MMD2, and MMD3.

4 channel tunes are played with medplayer.library version V6 or higher.
5-8 channel tunes are played with octaplayer.library version V6 or higher.
1-64 channel tunes (made OctaMED SoundStudio) are played with
octamixplayer.library version V7 or higher.

The few configurable items have been implemented by using the PS3M settings
in Prefs. They are as follows:

- High Quality mode with 5-8 channel modules and octaplayer.library is
toggled on when the PS3M mixing rate is at least 25000 Hz.  Otherwise it's
off.

- The mixing rate when using 1-64 channel modules and octamixplayer.library
is the same as the mixing rate in the PS3M settings.

- The play mode when using 1-64 channel modules and octamixplayer.library
is 8-bit unless you have 14-bit stereo set in PS3M settings.  If so,
octamixplayer.library will also use 14-bit output.



AHI audio system
----------------

AHI (Audio Hardware Inferface) device and driver based audio system by
Martin Blom <lcs@lysator.liu.se>.

The replayers in HippoPlayer that currently support AHI are: 
 · Protracker, Screamtracker 3, Fastracker 1 & 2, Multitracker,
   Taketracker, Hippel-COSO.

These music formats can thus be played thru any audio card that has an AHI
driver installed.  Amiga's own audio hardware can of course be used too
(there are 8-bit and 14-bit modes available). 

At least the following sound cards are currently supported:
 · Delfina
 · Toccata
 · Wavetools
 · Prelude

Configure AHI from preferences.

AHI requires at least kickstart 2.0.

** NOTE!  Don't try to use the external scopes while using AHI.  You have
been warned.



Audio samples
-------------
HiP is able to play the following audio sample formats:
- IFF 8SVX 8-bit mono/stereo
- AIFF 8/16-bit mono/stereo
- RIFF WAVE PCM 8/16-bit mono/stereo
- MP2 & MP3 (mpeg-1 layer 1, 2 and 3)

Samples can also be packed with the XPK system.  If the unpacking takes so
much time that the sound is distorted, you should try a faster xpk
sublibrary.

Samples can also be packed with the XPK system.

Some memory is needed for data buffers.  You can set the buffer size from
Prefs.  The routine may use upto 12 buffers, of which 8 in CHIP
memory.  This can be a lot if the buffer size is big.

Screenmodes with 15kHz horizontal refresh rates (eg PAL and NTSC) limit the
maximum sampling frequency to 28kHz.  HiP is able to play over 28kHz
samples on these screenmodes by reducing the sampling frequency in real
time.  This (of course) takes some extra CPU power and memory.  Because the
reducing operation is triggered when the horizontal screen refresh rate is
15kHz, I don't know how this works on GFX CARDS.

As default 16-bit samples are converted to 8-bit samples before playing.
However, much better sound quality can be achieved by selecting 14-bit
output.  This can be done from Prefs under Play-2, where you should enable
the CyberSound calibration.  (Again, the different conversions eat CPU
power.)

There's no `standard' 14-bit output available for sample playing, the only
choices are 8-bit output and 14-bit calibrated output.

Also note that with 14-bit sample output the volume gadget has no effect at
all.  This is because of the special way of outputting the sound.

The sample player supports AHI, so various sound cards can be used for
sound output.

MP2 & MP3
---------

This popular tightly packed music format is played using mpega.library
by Stephane Tavenard. You need lot's of power for these, at least 040.
The sample buffer size and other related settings work wor MPs too.

Other keys
----------
[ARROW UP] and [Number pad 8]: 
               Select previous module.
[ARROW DOWN] and [Number pad 2]:
               Select next module.

[F1-F10]:      Load & play a module or a module program.
               You can configure the function keys from prefs.

[Z]:           Open/close the scope window.

[O]:           Enter a file comment for the chosen file.

[E:            Execute a file chosen with a file requester.

[7/8/9/0]:     Titlebar info selector:
               7 = time, pos/len, song number
               8 = clock, free memory
               9 = module name
               0 = time, duration, pos/len

[G/H]:         Quick setting of the play mode:
               G = Set playmode to `List repeatedly'.
               H = Set playmode to `Modules in random order'.

[[]:           Join a module program to the end of the module list.
               See `Prg'.
	
[~]:           Zip/unzip window so that only the titlebar is shown
               and back to the original size.

               You can do the same thing by doing the following:
               · Click the window zoom gadget.
               · Click the right mousebutton on something that doesn't
                 have a RMB function.

               This button can also be used to bring the HiP window 
               to front with the hotkey. Useful if you have lost
               it amongst dozens of screens and other windows.			

[LAMIGA+LSHIFT+CONTROL]: The hotkey combination.

Press [HOTKEY]+[key] to use the HiP-keys WITHOUT first activating the
window.  This is one of the two ways (the other is ARexx) to control HiP
when it is hidden!

               [HOTKEY] + [H]: Hide the HiP main window completely.
                               This key also reveals the hidden window.
                               Also the key [~] will do, see above.
               [HOTKEY] + [1]: Zip/unzip window for hotkeys. See [~].




Filebox
-------
This is the module list.  There are two ways of selecting modules:

· Click left mousebutton on one of the names.

· Use arrow keys up and down to scroll the list. Shift increases
  scrolling speed.

The selected item will be enclosed in a selection bar.



Right mousebutton
-----------------
Pressing the right mousebutton will shrink the window so that only the
titlebar is shown.  Press again on the activated window to expand.



******************************************************************************
*                              *** Prefs ****				     *
******************************************************************************

By clicking on the Prefs gadget you can configure HippoPlayer by using the
gadgets.  Multiple choice requester can be invoked by pressing right
mousebutton on the cycle gadgets with `ears'.


Play
----
 · List repeatedly
   Play module list over and over.

 · List once
   Play list once and stop.

 · Module repeatedly
   Play one module over and over.

 · Module once
   Play one module once and stop.

 · Modules in random order
   Play  modules  in random order.  When playing has started, same module
   will not be played twice unless all modules have been played first.

`Play'  only  affects  the  replayers  where  the  end of the song can be
detected.



Timeout
-------
Set playing time (mins:secs).  Disabled in the leftmost position.  Timeout
can affect all modules or only those which the end can't be detected from.
You can select this by pressing 'Timeout'.

Example:  Play Protracker-modules until they end and PSIDs for, say 3
minutes.  Or you can play all kinds of modules for only 30 secs (intro scan
:)



Alarm
-----
Set a time for HiP to play a module (same as startup module).  Control
alarm with the slider, hh:mm.  To enable alarm, set titlebar info to clock.
To re-enable alarm, switch titlebar info to something else and then back to
clock.



Startup
-------
When enabled (with the checkbox left to alarm), HiP will start playing
immediately on startup.  The module or the program to be played can be
chosen by clicking the 'Startup' gadget.



Function keys
-------------
You can install a module or a module program for each of the function keys
(F1-F10) by clicking this gadget.  Then when you press a fkey, the
corresponding module program or module will be loaded and played.



Hotkeys
-------

Every key function in HiP can also be invoked by using this hotkey:

[LAMIGA+LSHIFT+CONTROL]+<key>

The purpose of the hotkey is to control HiP when the HiP window isn't
active.  For example you can draw with a paint program and change the tune
HiP is playing by pressing the appropriate hotkey combination.

Here you can enable/disable hotkeys.  Note that some other programs might
use the same hotkey!



Doubleclick
-----------
When enabled, a module can be loaded and played by doubleclicking on its
name.



Continue on error
-----------------
When this switch is enabled, errors that occur while loading will be
ignored, file will be skipped and the next one will be loaded.  After five
errors the procedure will be halted.



Early load
-----------
Select a pattern from end to start loading next module.  Works with formats
supporting position/length.

Currently this is quite a lame function, because the newly loaded module
starts to play immediately.



Divider / dir
-------------
When adding directories it is sometimes useful to have a list divider for
each scanned directory.  This switch enables just that.



Auto sort
---------
When enabled, the module list will always be sorted automatically after
adding files & dirs via file requester.



Priority
--------
Select a priority for HiP's processes:  -1, 0, +1.  All excluding the
scopes are affected.



Show (titlebar information)
----
 · Time, pos/len, song

   Show  playing  time,  song  position/length  and  song number/max song
   (#n/n)  depending of what kind of a module is being played, and module
   name.

 · Time/duration, pos/len

   This  does  exactly the same as above with all but Protracker modules
   and audio samples.  If  enabled,  HiP will calculate duration of PT
   modules and audio samples and show it in the titlebar.

 · Clock, free memory

   Show clock (24h) and free Chip and Fast in kilobytes.

 · Module name

   Show module name only.




Screen
------
Select a public screen.  All HiP's windows and requesters will be opened on
the defined screen.  If the screen is not available, default screen will be
used (usually Workbench).



Filebox (size)
--------------
Define the number of files shown simultaneously in the main window.
Minimum is 3 and maximum is 50.  If the value is too big for the current
screen it will be truncated.
The filebox can be removed from the window by selecting size 0.



Module info (size)
------------------
Select the amount of lines the module info window can hold.



Font
----
Select a 8x8 pixel font (kick2.0+ only).  All fixed width and 8 pixel high
fonts will be scanned and only those that are 8x8 pixel fonts are
displayed.



Scopes
------
Select one of the scopes by clicking the type gadget and the bar gadget.
The `Scope on/off' button or `z' key or RMB on the 1/3 of the infobox will
start it up.  You can close a scope by closing it's window, clicking the
gadget again or clicking RMB on the activated scope window.

These are for Protracker-modules only:

Quadrascope (& bars)
 - This is just like the one in Protracker.  Channel order:  1,2,3,4.
Hipposcope (& bars)
 - Couldn't invent a better name..  Bass-sounds look nice with this one.
   Channel order: 1,2,3,4.
Frequency analyzer (& bars)
 - This one's more processor intensive.  There is one for the left and the
   right side. It is supposed to display frequencies while not using
   period values. This is not FFT, but is based on Guru's strange idea...
   Bass-sounds are on the left and treble-sounds on the right.
   Bar channel order: 1,4,2,3.
Patternscope
 - Protracker-emulator... Shows pattern data, four fake VU-meters and four
   tiny period boxes.
   Channels: 1,2,3,4.
F. Quadrascope (& bars)
 - F. stands for filled. Inspired by Guru/S2's routine many years ago.
   Channels: 1,2,3,4.
Bars
 - These will try to visualize the volume and the period of each channel.
   The vertical position represents sample period and the width sample volume.   

There are almost the same scopes for PS3M:  Quadrascope (stereoscope),
hipposcope, frequency analyzer and filled quadrascope (stereoscope).  No
bars.

The sample player has monoscope and filled monoscope.

The scopes will need some kilobytes of memory for buffers.  They are run
with priority of -30 so that they won't interfere with anything important.



Prefix cut
----------
Select filename prefix cut.  Value 3 will cut prefixes like "mod.", "xm."
etc.  from the names in the filebox.  This will also affect the sorting of
the names.




Module directory
----------------
Select default module directory.



Program directory
-----------------
Same as above but for module programs.



Archivers (LhA... LZX... Zip...)
---------
HiP can decompress and play modules packed with LhA, LZX and Zip.  You need
to specify a path, a command and options for each.

Archives will be extracted into a temporary directory that will be created
in the user defined path (RAM:  is always the fastest while HD is good for
saving memory).  The directory is then scanned for files and the first
encountered music module will be loaded.

Requirements

 · LhA, LZX or UnZip, according to what kind of packed files you have.
   Define the exact location of each (eg dh1:bucket/lha)

 · `Run' and `Delete' commands in C: (or in path).

Hints

 · Archived files may be packed with XPK, FImp, Powerpacker or whatever
   format XFDmaster.library can decrunch.  For example you could use
   xpkDLTA to encipher a module and then LhA it.  Gives very good
   compression of sound related data.
 
 · You can store both TFMX mdat.* and smpl.* files in one archive!

Kick 1.2/1.3 note

LhA is probably the only one that works fine.
If the default unzip command fails you could try something like this:
'C:unzip >nil: -o -qq "%s" -d '


Archiver commands
-----------------

LhA: c:lha >nil: x -IqmMNXQw "%s"

c:lha           the program lha with complete path
>nil:           ignore any output
x               extract files
-IqmMNXQw	I       ignore LHAOPTS variable
		q       be quiet
		m       no messages for query
		M       no autoshow files
		N       no progress indicator
		X       no need to have the .lha suffix in filename
		Qw      disable wildcards
"%s"            the %s is the archive to be extracted.

LZX: lzx >nil: -m -q -X0 x "%s"

-m -q -X0       m       no messages for query
                q       be quiet
		X0	no need to have the .lzx suffix in filename
x               extract files

Zip: unzip >nil: -qq "%s"

-qq             qq      be very quiet




Doublebuffering
---------------
Normally when loading a module the one that already is playing is first
ejected.  With this button you can force HiP to play the current module and
load the next one at the same time.  Useful for floppy users, no delays
between playing.  If there's not enough memory to hold two mods at the same
time, the current module will be ejected first.



XPK identify
------------
When on, all XPKed files will be checked if they should be loaded in FAST
memory.  You should set this if you listen to modules played by PS3M.



XFDmaster library
-----------------
Use  XFDmaster.library  to  load  packed files of almost any packer format.
xfdmaster.library in Libs:  is needed of course.



File match pattern
------------------
Match pattern for file requesters and for adding files.




Player group
------------
Status: 	Player group loaded/not loaded.
Mode:		Loading conditions
		- All on startup: load the group immediately on startup
		- All on demand: load the group when there is demand for
			         a replayer
		- Disable: don't load the group and unload if already loaded
		- Load single: load a single replayer from the group 
	          when needed
File:		Player group file.



Filter control
--------------
Filter controlled by module, filter forced off or on.



Fade volume
-----------
This will cause those replayers that support volume to fade music in and
out.



Nasty audio
-----------
Select allocation priority of the audio channels.  When on, no program
except HiP can use the channels.  PS3M uses maximum priority at all times.



VBlank timer
------------
Select timing method to be used for playing: VBlank or CIA timer.

Use this switch if you don't want HiP to use one of the four CIA timers.
VBlank plays with wrong speed on non-50Hz screens.

This switch has no effect on the following:  PS3M, SID, Sonic Arranger,
TFMX, TFMX 7c, MED, The Player 6.1a, DIGI Booster.  They use their own way
of timing.

Tempo will be disabled when playing PT mods with VBlank timer.  Double and
quadruple playing speeds are disabled when using VBlank.



PT replayer
-----------
 · Normal

   Use normal Protracker replayer to play modules from CHIP RAM.

 · Fastram

   Play PT modules from FAST RAM.

 · PS3M

   Use Guru's PS3M to play modules from Chip or Fast.  This way you can
   use those neat modes, eg listen Protracker modules with real surround.



Protracker tempo
----------------
Enable or disable Protracker tempo command.  Useful for playing old modules
that use speeds higher than $1F.  Applies also to The Player modules.



TFMX rate
---------
Mixing rate for the 7-channel TFMX replayer.




Sample buffer (size)
--------------------
Define the buffer size for the audio sample player.  A small value might be
good for fast HDs, while big is be better with slower media.




Force sampling rate
-------------------
This is a setting for the audio sample player.

Normally the sampling rate is stored in the header of a sample.  This
slider allows you to override that rate so that HippoPlayer will use this
value instead of the one found in the sample.

To disable the override move the slider to the leftmost position.

** NOTE!  The sampling rate can be over 28.0 kHz only with some specific
screenmodes.



Cybercalibration
----------------
Enables the 14-bit Cybercalibrated output for the sampleplayer.
Better quality, lower volume, needs more cpu.


MPEGA quality
-------------
Controls the output quality for playing MP?-files.  Smaller number uses
less cpu and is of worse quality etc.


MPEGA freq. div.
----------------
Can be used to drop down the quality even more when playing MP?-files.
Divides the souce sampling rate by this number.


MED mode
--------
Affects 5-64 channel MED/OctaMED/OctaMEDSS etc modules.  8 means normal
8-bit low quality output, 14 means 14-bit high quality output.



PS3M settings
-------------
This replayer (by Guru/S2) can play S3Ms, XMs, FTMs, MODs and MTMs.
Some of these also affect in playing MED modules.

Play mode:	 Playing modes (see the PS3M doc for more info, or just
				try them out)
Priority:
	Pri -10 to +9
		  Set priority for the system friendly player process.
	Killer    Disable system and stop most of the DMA to get the best
                  quality. The blue flickering represents free CPU time.
		  Stop playing by pressing mousebuttons.  No enforcer!

Mixing buffer size:
	4kB, 8kB, 16kB, 32kB mixing buffer size.
	Smaller buffer gives faster response, but decreases the
	"backup" buffer possibly causing more "skipping".

Mixing rate:
	Mixing rate in kHz.

Volume boost:
	Makes the sound clearer and louder (use when 8 or more channels)
	You will hear the change almost immediately.

Stereo level:
	Works only with Surround play mode.
	You can adjust the strength of stereo. 0% is mono, 100% is stereo,
	and 50% is the normal surround value.

Use S:HippoPlayer.PS3M configuration file:
	Use a special configuration file for configuring PS3M.

use CyberSound calibration
	Set the enable switch and the name of the calibration file.
	CyberSound calibration takes effect when you have also enabled
	the 14-bit stereo mode. Also the 16-bit sample player will use
	this output mode if you have enabled it here.

	Creating a machine specific calibration table will decrease 
	the noise level and increase the sound quality.  This can be 
	done with 14Bit_Calibration, which can be found in
	HippoPlayer/Support/  directory.  The program belongs to
	the CyberSound audio subsystem package by Christian Buchner. Thanks!

	  As default the calibration table will be saved to	
	  ENVARC:CyberSound/SoundDrivers/14Bit_Calibration.

	  You really should try this out! The sound quality is very good
	  compared to 8-bit or standard 14-bit output! 



AHI audio system settings
-------------------------

Enable AHI:
  Makes those replayers that support AHI use it for sound output.
  The replayers that currently support AHI are:
   · Protracker, Screamtracker 3, Fastracker 1 & 2, Multitracker, 
     Taketracker, Hippel-COSO.

Disable non-AHI replayers:
   Do not play non-AHI supporting modules at all. An `Unknown file format'
   error will be shown.

Mode:
   Select AHI audio mode.

Mixing rate:
   The bigger value the better quality and bigger CPU load. 
   Watch out! It's easy to jam up the system with too high a value.      

Master volume:
   This value controls the volume level of AHI, just like volume boost
   with PS3M. Value of 0 means no boost. With too high values the
   sound will break and turn ugly. :)

Stereo level:
   Change the stereo level. 0% is full mono, 100% is full stereo.



Save, Use, Cancel
-----------------
I guess you can guess these.  If you close the prefs window it's same as
'Cancel'ling.  The prefs-file will be saved in the S:  directory.

*** NOTE:  Positions of the windows and some requesters are saved too.



******************************************************************************
*                        *** Command line options *** 			     *
******************************************************************************

Add modules to the list
-----------------------
HiP  <file2> <file2> ... <file16>

All the files will be added to the list and the first added one will be
played.


Load a module program
---------------------
HiP PRGM <module program>

The program will be loaded and the first module will be played.  If the
playmode is set as 'Modules in random order', then a random module will be
picked and played.  Existing list will be cleared.  (The PRGM-keyword is
not necessary, but is faster in terms of disk activity.)

All filenames must be entered with full paths!

*** NOTE:  You can also do these things while HiP is ALREADY running!  This
allows you to use HiP as a command line module player.  Eg in Directory
Opus it makes a good play button.


Hide on startup
---------------
HiP HIDE [other parameters]

HIDE makes HiP even more a command line player.  It will force HiP not open
it's window.  Also reqtools.library is not needed (it will be loaded later
if the window is opened).  HiP can be controlled with hotkeys (if enabled)
and/or ARexx if the window is not opened.


Quit
----
HiP QUIT

If there is already one HiP running, it will be terminated.

HiP has a tiny interface for programmers who want to c0de some scopes of
their own.  Check out the example source(s)!

What you do is FindPort() "HiP-Port".  If unsuccesful, HiP is not running.
Otherwise, you get the pointer to HippoPlayer's port.  It looks like this:

*** NOTE:  DON'T WRITE ANYTHING TO THE PORT!

*** hip_opencount ***

As soon as you get the pointer to HippoPlayer's port, add 1 to
hip_opencount.  When you are done, subtract 1 from hip_opencount.

*** hip_quit ***>

If this byte becomes non-zero, your scope (or whatever) must quit.

*** PT hints ***

Each channel has it's own trigger byte:  hip_PTtrigger1, hip_PTtrigger2
etc..  When a new sample starts to play, the corresponding channel trigger
is incremented by 1.

PTch_start is updated so that it always points to the current playing
position of the sample.  PTch_length will decrease until it hits zero.
When this happens, PTch_start is replaced with PTch_loopstart and
PTch_length is replaced with PTch_replen.  In other words, the sample
loops.  If the loop size is 2 bytes (PTch_length = 1, PTch_replen = 1),
the sample stops (plays null).  Don't read past the sample data; always
check PTch_length.

The hip_kplbase points to the data area of my Protracker replayer.  This
makes it possible to do scopes like patternscope.  Contact me if you want
the structure definition.

*** PS3M hints ***

hip_ps3moffs is an offset from the start of the buffers pointing to the
current playing position.  Don't read past bufferstart+hip_ps3mmaxoffs.

******************************************************************************

 · Main  window  refresh  may  get dangerously confused when when zipping

 · Timeout  and  alarm  don't  work  if  there's  no timer visible in the
   titlebar.
	
 · Some Fred modules cause enforcer hits.

 · Sonic Arranger tunes tend to crash sometimes.

 · Scopes  bug  with  PT  9xx  command.  This  one  originates  from  the
   Protracker itself (my PT replayer really is 100% PT compatible :)

 · If you click outside the slider but in the gadget area at the same
   time when activating a window, the gadget might not respond. I've
   heard that this is a bug in in AmigaOS.

 · Some mysterious bugs in ARexx... (?)

- German guide by Dominik Deobald. Thanks!
- Multi-archive-multi-file-player-script HiPPack v1.2a by Jari Karjalainen. 
  Thanks!



v2.37 (31.12.1996)
------------------

A quick bug fix release.  There were two bad bugs:
One crashed the 68000/68010 CPUs and one crashed the old pre-2.0
kickstarts.


v2.38 (9.2.1997)
----------------

Bug fixes:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- MusiclineEditor volume problems fixed.
- Add-files-run-out-of-memory-crash-bug removed.
- The AHI stereo level bug removed.
- Bug in the doc: key command for 'Insert files' is [T], not [I], 
  which is 'Open info window'.

Improvements:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- A new lightning fast sort algorithm: comb sort!  Based on the
  asm source by Origo/C-Lous^Subspace.  With 2686 files the old
  bubble sort takes 40 secs where the new comb sort takes only
  0.5 seconds.. Measured on my Amiga.

- Possibility to enter file comments. Hit [O] for this feature.

- New THX replayer. Some bugs fixed, no more 2x and 4x speeds :-\
  May not work on 68000. :-\\
- Info window now shows THX sample names. 

- Sample player is now able to play >28khz samples on screenmodes
  where this is not normally possible (= horizontal refresh 15kHz). 
  Needs some more CPU power and memory for scaling the sample data.

New support stuff:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- New French guide by Alan Guillevic.
- Spanish guide by Jose Antonio Diaz (Humphrey/Centolos). Thanks dudez!


v2.39 (19.4.1997)
-----------------

** Do not use <kpk@pcuf.fi> or <kpkoljon@kauhajoki.fi> anymore.

Bug fixes:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- 'Error opening file'-bug with THX modules fixed.
- No need to have audio.device anymore, should work on Draco systems now.
- A bug removed in archive loader. I suppose.
- MED library opening fixed. I suppose..
- Numerous little things.
- The module name aesthetic preprocessor improved to handle Roman
  numerals ;)

Improvements:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- File comment with [O] now displays the old comment for editing.
- Hopefully more random random routine.
- RMB + `Play' = play a random module.
- New key function [E]: execute a file chosen with a file requester.
- Halved the infobox sample play volume.
- Hacked the THX replayer (again) to make it 68000 compatible.

New support stuff:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- Updated Spanish guide by Humphrey/Centolos.
- Updated German guide by Dominik Deobald
- Updated Italian guide by Valerio Russo.
- New Swedish guide by Johan "S.Duvan" Alfredsson & Henrik "Puh" Nilsson.
  Thanks a lot fellows! :-]




v2.40 (29.6.1997)
-----------------

Bug fixes:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- THX subsongs work now.
- AHI volume problem fixed.
- Some problems with XMs and AHI fixed.

Improvements:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- Support for Digi Booster Pro modules. NOTE! The replayer requires
  AHI and 68020 or better to work.
- Support for 4 channel Art Of Noise modules.
- PC to Amiga charset conversion performed in the moduleinfowindow.
- When using random play the random markers will be cleared after ALL
  modules have been played.
- Faster loading of module programs (needs twice the memory as before).
- Uses screennotify.library (if available) to watch changes in the
  Workbench screen.

New support stuff:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- New external scope: WaterScope. Needs 020 or better.

- Updated Polish guide by Tomasz Kepa.

- PlayNext.HiP by Nils Goers.
- Two new drawer icons by Tomas Amsrud.



v2.41 (25.10.1997)
------------------

- Note that I have new email and www addresses.  Try to use them
  if possible. The old addresses will continue to work too.
- Special registration fee for Polish HiPpo users: 6 USD.

Bug fixes:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- The infamous 'crash-on-Picasso96-as-well-as-with-MCP' graphics bug
  fixed! And as a side effect the gfx rendering became a lot faster.
- Delete file bug removed.
- Clicking on the empty file box -bug removed.
- Now should randomize correctly after 'New' when play mode set
  as 'Play modules in random order'.
- The unified TFMX mdat+smpl format converter sometimes converts the songs
  wrongly which causes problems. Should be no problems with HiP now (wasn't
  a HiP bug, but anyway).
- Some small fixes.

Improvements:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- THX v2.10 support with pos/len display & forward/backward jump.
- Better support for MED subsongs.
- Now converts some module names from PC to Amiga format too.
- The sample player supports AHI. Yikes to all those who requested it.
  ** NOTE: This feature has some bugs left in it! I decided to release
  this version anyway because I didn't want to postpone the release further
  into the future. Report all weird behaviour pleeze.

New support stuff:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- Updated Polish guide by Tomasz Kepa.
- New ARexx script CopyList.HiP by Tomasz Kepa.
- Useless scope that's not a scope by me. 020+.

¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯

-----------------

Improvements:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- Updated THX replayer.
- MP1, MP2 and MP3 support using mpega.library by Stephane Tavenard.
- Some new stuff in Prefs for controlling MPEGA and MED.
- Module programs now saved as normal text files that can be edited
  by hand.
- Some changes in HippoPort.

New support stuff:
¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯¯
- External spectrum analyzer scope that uses FFT.  The spectrum goes from 0
  Hz to 8000 Hz, with steps of 125 Hz.  Pretty fast, I think.
