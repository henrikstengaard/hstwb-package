FFT v1.1 scope for HippoPlayer
------------------------------

External spectrum analyzer scope that uses FFT to extract spectral
components out of music.  The spectrum goes from 0 Hz to 8000 Hz, with
steps of 125 Hz.  The display is updated every frame.  It's quite fast on
my A1200/030/28MHz, faster than the FFTs in Deli and Eagle.  It even runs
quite smooth on A500+kick13.  Tested with WinUAE :)

Requirements: any Amiga with 300kB free memory, HippoPlayer

68000-030 optimized assembler k0dez by K-P, based on a C++ source by
Guru/S2.
