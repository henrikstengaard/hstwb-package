	This program was made after we had enough of cursing over badly
	coded, inequal and often inaccurate copy-programs.
	Because of this we decided to create a copier superior to all
	other copiers seen before, and this is it...
	D-Copy is developed by hackers for hackers, and suited for your
	needs, and therefore D-Copy should be your choice from now on!!
	


notes:	D-Copy v3.1 has been tested on:
	  *  A1000
	  *  A500, A500+
	  *  A2000/2500
	  *  A3000
          *  A4000 (some bugs known 'NIB')

	D-Copy has been tested with:
	  *  512k - 16meg memory expansion
          *  2 Meg ChipMem
	  *  1-4 external + harddrive
	  *  Kickstart v1.1 - v3.1 (40.38)
	  *  TurboCards (68030 + 040)


features - switches:
--------------------
SRC:	Source drive DF0: - DF3:

DEST:	Destination drive(s) DF0: - DF3:
	Writing will affect all destination drives selected. If
	destination and source drive is the same, D-Copy will
	copy in single-drive mode.
	

DOS 1:	Copies standard DOS tracks, including errors.        

DOS 2:	Copies standard DOS tracks with corrected errors. Checksums
	are recalculated and some header info are also corrected.
	Otherwise the same as DosCopy 1. Use when data is lost due to
	read errors. This will not recover all data but should be able
	to save some of it.

DOS 3:  Copies standard DOS track but uses the Bitmap to find out which
        tracks that contains data so it only have to copy tracks with data
        on and format the rest.

NIB 1:	Copies foreign formats. Use when disks are copy-protected...

NIB 2:	Basically the same as NibbleCopy 1, but uses a different
	method to find the track gap.

NIB 3:  Copies MS-DOS disks (720 Kb). This routine is NOT ready yet.
        The copy routine is working and so is some of the error checking-
        routines. The only thing that isn't working is the checksum routine
        for the header and data section. I had some problems with their
        strange checksum-format.
	

CHK:	Checks standard DOS tracks for errors in the selected source drive.

FMT:    Format standard DOS disks. When prompted for the diskname, you can
        select single tracks to be formated by clicking in the grid or just
        start the operation to do a normal format.

NAME:	Tells the name of the disk in the selected source drive.

DEF:	Sets SIDE 0/1, START+END TRACK, SYNC-WORDS, and SYNC-CORRECTOR
	to the default values.
	
ERR:	Click on ERR and then on an error in the grid to get a 
	short explanation of what it is.

DRIVE:	Scans the system for connected diskdrives (should find 5'25"
	not tested) Handy if you forgot to turn on any drives.

START/
END:	Click in the grids to select start and end track.
	Left mouse button for START and right for END.

0/1:	Selects which head to copy; Top, Bottom, or Both.





FFS:	Only used in formatting. Disk will be formated with
	FastFileSystem. 

RAM:	Tracks are stored in memory; same as single-drive copy, but
	may be written more than once to selected destinations.
	
VRFY:	Verifies selected destinations. Verify errors are displayed
	in blue digits, where the digit is the drive number. If more
	than one drive gets a verify error on the same track, a blue
	X will appear instead of a digit.
	The verify isn't completely dependable, because the verfication
	starts half a second after the writing has started (e.g. the
	the writing of one track takes half a second). The verify
	routine will read the track correctly, but a damaged track
	may hold this data for a certain amount of time and then 
	lose it. To be sure, wait a while between copying and
	checking target disks for errors.
	Use SAFE button to make the verify safer...

SAFE:	Makes a CheckDisk after selected operation (copy or format)
	This method is safer than Verify because there is more time
        between the writing to the disk and the reading (checking)
        from it, so if a track is bad it will probably lose it's
        contens before the check has started and you will get an error.

	


CRUNCHER MENU:
        Use this only if you are short on memory, because it takes more
        time. The tracks are crunched and stored into memory under singel-
        drive copy. The higher cruncher level, the more data you can
        store in memory (and ofcourse it takes more time too).



SYNCMENU:
	When the sync switch is on, all sync-marks will be recalculated
	during copy. This option should be turned off when copying
	foreign formats!
	The sync-mark is a mark that the disk controller uses to
	find the start of a track or sector on the disk. The standard
	mark for the Amiga is $4489. If you change this, the disk
	controller won't find any valid data on the disk. This can
	be used as a kind of copy-protection, because if you don't
	know the correct sync-word for the tracks, the disk becomes
	completely unreadable.
	The 'READ' and 'WRT' switches above the sync button stands for
	read/write sync-word. If you change the write-sync to an
	other value and copy the disk with this, the disk becomes
	unreadable if you don't know the correct sync-word. Crypting
	protection for valuable disks can be made with this kind of
	operation. You just have to set the read-sync to the same 
	value as you had on the write-sync before and the write-sync
	to the standard sync-word($4489) to get back a readable disk!
	When you choose your 'secret' sync-word you have to let D-Copy
	calculate it for you by pressing the up or down arrows on
	the 'i' selector to the right of the sync-word. This assures
	you that the sync-word is a valid sync value to be used as
	a sync-mark. WARNING! Use this option with caution, since
			      incorrect usage will destroy all data.




features - buttons:                        
-------------------                        
KILL:	Removes the system to increase memory.
	Very handy for those who are short of RAM. Use when copying
	in single-drive mode.
	When clicking on the exit button the computer will reset.
	This is a true reset routine (i.e expansion boards are found
	when the system is rebooting). 
	
GO!:	Starts the selected function.

ESC:	Aborts the selected function.

R:	Makes a retry on damaged tracks after a copy. Has shown to
	be very successful in reading damaged tracks.



features - specials:
--------------------
SPD:	Selects what speed with which to step the head from one
	track to another. Speeds are 1 - 9 (Fast to Slow).
	Most drives can't handle a speed faster than 3. You'll
	have to try out what speed is the best for your drive!
	Don't take any chances with using a faster speed than
	your drive can handle. This will only result in read
	errors on your destination disks.
	
ATT:    The number of attempts to read damaged tracks. Also affects
	the number of writings during verification. The retries are
	displayed on the right side of each track-grid.
	Slightly below these 'Retry-indicators' you will find another
	pair of indicators which indicates how many tracks that failed
	to be read correctly or was correctly read after retries. 

VC:	If this Led is on, DCopy has found a VirusCheck-library and
	a valid BootBlock-brainfile. Virus checking is now enabled
	when you are checking disks (CHK) or copying disks in one of
	the 'DOS' modes. The name of the library should be
	'libs:Bootblock.library' and the name of the brainfile should
	be 'l:Bootblock.brainfile'.

	
Comments:
---------
MOUSE:	Mouse will be freezed when clicking the RIGHT mouse button
	over the GO-R-ESC area. Indicated by pointer turning yellow.

MODES:	If you have selected the same source and destination drive
	the program will turn on single-drive mode automatically. This
	is the only way to get into single-drive mode.

DRIVES:	If you have connected more than one external drive you may get
	some problems with power consumption. Having a four-drive system
	working requires a lot of power so you just have to see if your
	powersupply can deliver the amount your drives need.

SECTOR-SCANNERS:
	These 'scanners' is found below each track-grid. The right one
	in each grid reports 'Sector OK' information by either turning
	green or red (Good, Bad). When a damaged track is read, DCopy
	stores all the good sectors and makes a new read (retry). If some
	of the new read sectors are good which was bad in the previous
	readings, DCopy replaces the bad (old) sector with the good (new).
	This helps a lot if you want to read a damaged track. The scanner
	to the left is showing which sectors has been read OK.
	



	The testing of this program has been made by several of my
	friends and the D-MOB crew, who also gave me moral support
	during intense bug-fixing periods. I also wish to thank all
	those who sent me bug-reports and ideas on how to improve
	D-Copy and you are now able to enjoy the result!

	how to improve D-Copy, please write or call me at:
