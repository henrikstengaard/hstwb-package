==============================
 SHORT description of KingCON
==============================

   KingCON is a console-handler that optionally replaces the standard
'CON:' and 'RAW:' devices. It is 100% compatible, but adds some VERY
useful features, such as..
   * Filename-completion (TAB-expansion)
   * A review-buffer
   * Intuition menus
   * Global preferences
   * Jump-scroll. (FAAST output!)
   * Asynchronous typeahead. (Optional)
   * Cursor-positioning using the mouse
   * MC68020-optimized version
   * And more...


========================
 Installation and usage
========================

   If you don't like reading manuals longer than one screen-page, then
install KingCON by running 'Installation'. This copies the necessary files
and mounts 'KCON:' and 'KRAW:' for you.
   To start a Shell that opens in a KingCON-console, type the following (in
an already opened shell):

	NewShell WINDOW KCON:
or
	NewShell WINDOW KCON:////Testing/CLOSE/JUMP

   If you now want to try out the filename-completion, type this:

   	type s:sta

   Hit the TAB-key (directly after the last 'a'), and you will get the idea
with filename-completion. Or do you always spell 'Startup-Sequense'
correctly in less that 1 second?

   Even if you don't like it, please read KingCON.doc or KingCON.guide for
a thorough explanation of all the new features that KingCON brings!
