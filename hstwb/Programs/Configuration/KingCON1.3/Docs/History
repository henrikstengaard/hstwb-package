KingCON v1.3 (31.05.94)
=======================

	New features:
	-------------
	* Filename completion can be performed much faster now thanks to
	  an internal directory cache. It is activated with the option
	  DIRCACHE<filecachesize>/<commcachesize>/<volumes>.
	  The cache is shared among all open KingCON-consoles. Please
	  look in the documentation for details about this feature.

	* Two new menuitems under the "Console" menu to make the console
	  window jump to the next public screen, or to a screen you
	  select from a list.

	* A new substitution-string, %A, can be used to insert the
	  current directory in the titlebar (or icon's title), where as
	  much as possible of the path has been replaced with an assign.
	  (For example, "Ram Disk:ENV/Sys" => "ENV:Sys")

	* The substitution-string %V inserts just the volumename of
	  the current directory.

	* Two new line-editing keys have been added:

	     Control-P	- Repeats the previous word.

	     Control-T	- Inserts the arguments for the previus command
	     		  stored in the history-buffer.

	* The select-window is opened under the mousepointer to
	  make life easier for SunMouse-users.

	* The new NOSHORTCUTS-option removes the Amiga-key shortcuts
	  for the menus. This is useful if you for example can't get
	  used with the fact that the console responds to Amiga-Q.

	Fixed problems:
	---------------
	* The DOS doesn't hang if KingCON is run together with xData.
	  (The fault is xData's, though :) Note that a diskloaded
	  font can't be used in the window if you are running xData.
	  If you experience problems with diskloaded fonts in combination
	  with other programs that patch the AmigaDOS Open()-function,
	  then PLEASE contact me.

	* Several problems with different versions of the
	  dir-replacement "ls" solved.

	* The select-window could crash and cause enforcer-hits
	  on some machines. Shouldn't do that anymore.

	* Doesn't crash if a non-existant prefs-file was specified,
	  either by putting the name right after KCON: or using
	  the PREFS-option.

	* Empty "path-components" in the filename used to open a
	  KCON-window caused enforcer-hits.

	* Pending packets to the handler aren't lost when the window
	  is iconified.

	* Sometimes the review-buffer could insert line-feeds in
	  wrong places.

	* After using the review-buffer, the console doesn't slow
	  down on deep screens anymore.

	* The control-sequence that is generated when the close-gadget
	  is pressed in raw-mode is now correct.

	* The raw-mode in a window opened in cooked mode reports
	  control-sequences in a way that is compatible with CON:

	* ARexx-programs can now be stopped with Control-C.

	* The packets ACTION_STACK and ACTION_QUEUE returned
	  ERROR_ACTION_NOT_KNOWN, even if they were supported
	  by the handler.

	* ACTION_CHANGE_SIGNAL now has the correct returncodes.

	* KingCON sometimes lost track of the current dir when
	  started from the OS2.0 Shell-icon.

	* The system's default font is always used in a window opened
	  on the Workbench, instead of the screen font.

	* Some cosmetical misfeatures in the filename-completion
	  were removed.


KingCON v1.2 (22.03.94)
=======================

	New features:
	-------------
	* Default options can be saved in an environment variable.

	* Added new selection-methods that don't involve opening a window
	  when several files match during filename-completion.
	  This is configured with the FNCMODE-option.

	* The memory for the review-buffer can be static if you specify a
	  negative value after MAXBUF.

	* An extra gadget in the titlebar lets you iconify the window
	  quickly using the mouse. The image comes from MUI by
	  Stefan Stuntz.

	* The review-buffer has gone through some cosmetic changes, making
	  it look better when you scroll through it.

	* You can now insert the current directory, process number etc
	  in the titlebar by using substitution-strings, like the
	  AmigaDOS Prompt-command.

	* A custom icon, to use when the console is iconified, can be
	  defined with the IMAGE-option. An exact position on the
	  screen can be specified with ICONPOS<x>/<y>.

	* The title for the icon can be specified with ICONTITLE.

	* MENUFY-option to create a menuitem in the Tools-menu when
	  the window is iconified.

	* KEEPCLOSED-option to prevent the window from opening if text is
	  ouput to the console while it is iconified.

	* FASTUPDATE-option for increasing the speed of the review-buffer.
	  Especially useful for 68000-owners. It works by simply updating
	  the scrollbar more seldom.

	* POPSCREEN-option to bring the screen, on which the window is
	  opened, to front.

	* New editing- and manouveringkeys:

	    Control-Left Arrow	- Moves to the previous part of a filename.
	    Control-Right Arrow	- Moves to the next part of a filename.
	    Control-Up Arrow	- Moves up one line in the review.
	    Control-Down Arrow	- Moves down one line in the review.
	    Control-Backspace	- Deletes a part of a filename to the left.
	    Control-Delete	- Deletes a part of a filename to the right.

	* New menu-shortcuts:
	    Amiga-J		- Enable/disable jump-scroll.
	    Amiga-.		- Show/hide .info-files.
	    Amiga-W		- Enable/disable review-buffer.

	* When completing a filename and no files match your pattern,
	  the devicelist is searched automatically, (just as if you
	  had pressed Shift-TAB).

	* When you Maximize a window, it doesn't cover the first
	  raster line of the screen, so you easily can drag it
	  with the mouse.


	Things that should have been in earlier versions:
	-------------------------------------------------
	* RAW: works now.

	* The console doesn't hang if you have v36 of diskfont.library.
	  KingCON can even run if some disk-based libraries are
	  missing, but some features will be disabled.

	* The filename-completion doesn't keep any directory-locks.

	* KingCON doesn't crash when trying to open its window on SID2.

	* The window is activated when you drop an icon on it.

	* WINDOW-option accepts 0x in front of the address like CON:

	* SCREEN-option recognises * as the top screen like CON: does.

	* Stored command-lines are printed before they are executed when
	  you have specified asynchronous typeahead.

	* Failing to complete a filename doesn't produce a NULL-character
	  on the command-line.

	* Wildcards can be used when completing device-names.

	* The path in the window-title doesn't mysteriously disappear.

	* KingCON understands which process to signal better.

	* SetKeyMap works in a KingCON-window.

	* The correct font is always used when opening a window on a
	  public screen.

	* The ARexx-commands Queue, Push and Lines can now be used
	  in a KingCON-window. They all use some of the many
	  undocumented features of CON:. For example, WaitForChar()
	  returns the number of lines in the console's internal
	  readbuffer in IoErr().

	* Lots of other things that you probably never noticed.


KingCON v1.1 (15.12.93)
=======================

	New features:
	-------------
	* Some more edition functions were added:

	    Shift-BS		- Deletes the line to the left.
	    Shift-Del		- Deletes the line to the right.
	    Alt-BS		- Deletes a word to the left.
	    Alt-Del		- Deletes a word to the right
	    Amiga-Del		- Deletes a whole word.
	    Shift-RETURN	- The current command-line is saved to
	    			  the history-buffer, but it isn't executed.

	* The ALT-option allows you to specify the zoom-size more precisely
	  than MINI.

	* Asynchronous typeahead is possible with the ASYNC-option.

	* When a filename with spaces is in it is selected with filename-
	  completion, leading and trailing quotationmarks are added.

	* You can now drop Workbench icons in the console window to insert
	  their filenames in the command line.

	* The console window can be iconified and put on the Workbench
	  as an AppIcon. This replaces the Minimize-function.

	* AmigaDOS wildcards can be used when completing filenames.

	* The current directory is shown in the titlebar if you specify
	  the SHOWDIR-option.

	* The review-buffer's maximum size can be set with the MAXBUF-option.


	Features that should have been in v1.0:
	---------------------------------------
	* The 68000-version doesn't contain any 68020-compiled code...

	* The console doesn't freeze randomly in RAW-mode.

	* Keymaps with multiple-character keys are understood properly.

	* The ASL-requester no longer generates Enforcer-hits.

	* It is possible to use Amiga-V for pasting in RAW-mode.

	* The window's title can now contain ':'.

	* The '['-character is visible in the review-buffer.

	* The review-buffer understands CR better.

	* In addition to this, some minor bugs were fixed in the
	  command-line editing and the scrollgadget.
