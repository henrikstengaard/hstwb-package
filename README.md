- Build-in support for ACA, Furia and Blizzard accelerator cards.
- Boot selectors for starting AGS2 Games, Demos menus, Workbench or CLI for maximum available memory.
- Configure setup: A menu to easily configure setup of hardware, device & library, boot sequence and WHDLoad.
- Configure kickstart roms: A menu to easily install Kickstart roms for WHDLoad.
- Tools installed: MUI, WHDLoad.
- Programs installed: DirOpus, DCopy, Deluxe Paint 4, DiskSalv, Find, HippoPlayer, JoyPortTest, ProTracker, ReOrg, SuperDuper, SysInfo, TSgui, TransWrite, VirusZ and Visage.

## Requirements

HstWB package requires BetterWB package is installed, when selecting packages to install in either HstWB Installer install mode or running a self install image.

## Installation

Download latest release from https://github.com/henrikstengaard/hstwb-package/releases and copy it to HstWB Installer "packages" directory, which typically is "c:\Program Files (x86)\HstWB Installer\Packages".

Installation through HstWB Installer will install and configure HstWB package using defined assigns.

## Assigns

Installation of HstWB package requires and uses following assign and default value:

- SYSTEMDIR: = DH0:

HstWB files will be installed and configured in SYSTEMDIR: assign, which must be set to harddrive containing Workbench.

## First time boot

First time HstWB is booted after installation, it will automatically start configure setup. This allows changing configuration for most optimal use on the Amiga it's installed on.

3. Workbench: Starts Workbench and enabled patches.
4. CLI: Starts CLI for maximum avialable memory.

A 5 second timer will automatically select last used boot option, which by default is Games.

Amiga Boot Selector can be changed by pressing F1. This allows changing existing boot options or add new ones.
